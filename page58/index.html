    <p>After being off of IM for the last few weeks, I finally got around to re-installing <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a>.  (I still had not installed it after my last hard drive crash.)  I was happy to see a new version since I had been running my registered copy of Trillian Pro 2.x for the last few years.<br /><br />The new version includes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> feature.  It will display the Wikipedia description when you mouse over certain works and phrases.  But it’s not perfect.<br /><br />I mentioned a buddy of name Shawn Murphy.  To my surprise there was a Wikipedia desription for have name.  “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Murphy">Shawn Murphy</a> (born July 27, 1951 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island) is a Canadian politician. Murphy is a current member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the Canadian House of Commons,…”  I’m not sure way but I found this to be funny.  <br /><br />The Wikipedia feature is a neat idea, but I’m not sure how useful it will be for me.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>For over a year I have been running my primary development environment in a guest OS using VMWare Workstation 4.x.  I run in full screen mode and I don’t even notice that I am running under a guest OS.<br /><br />Tonight I installed the new VMWare Workstation 5.0.  I haven’t run it through the ringer yet but I like what I see so far.  Guest OS seem to run faster and network communication is definitely much faster.  The old virtual NIC was only a 10mbps.  The new one is 1gbps, which is noticeably faster.  Although I haven’t played with it, I’m excited about the multiple snapshots feature.  There’s also a new clone feature that I need to read up on.  In my opinion existing 4.x users will want to upgrade to 5.0.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Going back to a programming language that you have not touched in years is hard.  Syntax is easy, it comes back quickly.  But trying to remember all the details, runtime library calls, and so on can be a real brain buster.  And add to that that Delphi has had many improvements since 2000 in its VCL and runtime library.  <br /><br />It’s funny how knowledge will leak from your brain when the knowledge hasn’t been referenced in years.  It’s like opening a jar of whatever that hasn’t been opened in years only to find that much of the content has evaporated.</p>

    <p>I have started work on the application framework for Vertigo.  Well sort of.  [Vertigo is the code name for the product I have mentioned a couple of times over the last week.]  I have a very nice framework implemented in C# that has evolved over the years, but Vertigo is being written in Delphi.  And now I face the hardest part…starting with an empty palette.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I read an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4167633.stm">article</a> that talks about how e-mail is becoming an information database for people.  I have been thinking a lot about this over the last year as I have become more dependent on the information stored as e-mail.  I keep most e-mails I send and receive especially those related to <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>.  I keep every e-mail sent to and received from my wife.  I keep the receipts from online purchases, and so on.  I even have archives of e-mails that date back to the mid-90s.<br /><br />It has reached a point were managing all this information is a struggle.  Programs I use no longer meet my needs for managing the information I wish to store.  And while certain add-in products for the program I use help, I still feel like there has to be a better way.<br /><br />I have traveled to the far ends of the web searching for a program that will meet my needs.  I found many programs that satisfy certain requirements but I have yet to find the one product that addresses all my needs.  Or even 80% of my needs.  What’s a poor software developer to do?<br /><br />Well, this poor software developer has decided to take on a new challenge and produce a product that will satisfy the requirements I have for personal information management.  This is by no means a simple task.  This is not the type of program that I can crank out in a week or two and hope to start selling.  The reality is that it will probably take a year or more to be as feature rich as I would like.  But I believe this is something that <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak</a> can produce.<br /><br />Fyi, the decision to produce this product explains why I have been toying around with Delphi over the last month.  I personally believe there is no better development language for Windows development then Delphi.</p>

        <a href="/2005/04/27/icca-nyc-metro-meeting-recap/">ICCA NYC Metro Meeting Recap</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>It’s not often I’m blown away by a non-technical presentation but that’s what happened last night at the ICCA NYC Metro meeting.  Jeremy Rawitz presented an “in brief” version of his “Breaking the Rules…and Close more Sells” talk.  In my opinion, this was the best presentation to date since I started attending the monthly meetings.<br /><br />Jeremy uses an interactive approach to get points across.  The exercises started with breaking the group up into teams, but instead of saying “Pick 4 people” or “This group of people is Team 1, this group is Team 2” and so on the teams formed themselves.  <br /><br />Pictures of animals were hanging on the walls.  Jeremy asked the attendee to go stand by the animals that you feel best reflect yourself.  People stood next to an animal of choice and next thing we knew teams were formed.<br /><br />There was an instance bond on each team since each team member already shared something in common, the belief that the animal best represented him or herself.  While the focus on the presentation was on a new sells approach, I was immediately impressed Jeremy’s approach to breaking the group up into teams.<br /><br />Things continued to get better from there.  Teams did different exercises to understand the traditional sells process and the problems associated with it.  Additional exercises and roll playing were used illustrating a new approach to sells, which felt like a more natural approach.  <br /><br />At the end of the meeting, I was left with wanting more.  Jeremy’s presentation was only a taste of his workshop, which I can only imagine is most excellent.</p>
