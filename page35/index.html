        <a href="/2006/01/11/finalbuilder-is-a-must-have-for-constructing-build-processes/">FinalBuilder is a Must Have for Constructing Build Processes</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>For years I have relied on custom built build processes for software I develop.  For instance, on a recent large-scale .NET solution I used a combination of NTScheduler, VMware Workstation, CVS, NAnt, and the .NET SDK (along with other tools) to build an automated build environment.  However, doing something similar for every one of my software projects is time consuming, and I have to rely on different tools for different projects.  For example NAnt is useless for a Delphi Win32 project.  So I finally decided to give FinalBuilder a try.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.finalbuilder.com/">FinalBuilder is the ultimate tool for constructing a build process</a>.  Within minutes I was able to automate a build process for a box inventory program I am working on.  Of course projects with a more complex build process will take more than a few minutes to setup, but you should be able to automate a build process in minutes and not hours or days for most projects.  <br /><br />I’m amazed at the flexibility provided by FinalBuilder.  It supports a wide array of compilers and tools.  And it has an easy-to-use GUI for construction of the build process for every time of project I’m working on.<br /><br />I decided to see how long it would take to setup a build process for <a href="http://www.smtpdiagnostics.com/">SMTP Diagnostics</a>.  Although SMTP Diagnostics is a simple product, its build process involves a number of steps.  It is the perfect product to evaluate FinalBuilder with.  <br /><br />Here are the steps in the build process that I wanted to automate through FinalBuilder:<br /><br />- Create a build directory sandbox<br />- Retrieve the latest source code from <a href="http://www.cvsnt.org">CVS</a><br />- Compile the GUI program (using <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 compiler)<br />- Compile <a href="http://www.eurekalog.com/">EurekaLog</a> into the GUI program<br />- Compile to console program (using <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 compiler)<br />- Compile the licensing framework into the GUI and console programs (using <a href="http://www.siliconrealms.com/software.shtml">Armadillo</a>)<br />- Generate the help file system (using <a href="http://www.ec-software.com/hmpage.htm">Help&amp;Manual;</a>)<br />- Generate the installer (using <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>)<br />- Generate a zip file containing the generated installer<br />- Update and commit build number changes to CVS<br />- Tag release in CVS<br /><br />In less than 30 minutes I was able to setup the SMTP Diagnostics build process in FinalBuilder.  I can now make a complete build of SMTP Diagnostics in under a minute with a click of a button.  <br /><br />My next step in exploring FinalBuilder will be to generate the online help as HTML files and upon successful build of the product push the HTML files and the installer out to SMTP Diagnostics web site.  Given the time I spent playing with FinalBuilder, I’m confident I will be able to automate these steps as well.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>For Christmas Melanie gave me a copy of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/d/deadoralive4/">Dead Or Alive 4</a> for the Xbox 360.  The game wasn’t released until the end of the December so I had to wait.  But it finally came in this week and last night I got a chance to play it.<br /><br />My review can be summed up in 4 simple words: My thumb is sore!<br /><br />I must have played 8 hours or so last night.  And yes my thumb is sore.  The game is awesome.  Story Mode can be frustrating at times but I was able to finish it in one night.  The frustration is not a bad thing although it seems like it when you are playing.  The AI in this game is incredible, which made Story Mode challenging and frustrating at the same time.<br /><br />Like other Xbox 360 games DOA4 supports leaderboards.  You can, for example, compare your best Survival Mode score against other players world wide.  My current ranking is around 10,500 out of 25,000 players.  I definitely need to work on improving that ranking.  <br /><br />As I have mentioned before, Xbox Live really makes Xbox 360 a great console.  Having the ability to compare my ranking and achievement to other players causes me to play more, and in turn leaves me wanting to buy more games.  Xbox Live is really the shining star of the Xbox 360 for the moment.  But this review is about DOA4, not Xbox Live.<br /><br />DOA4 comes with online play as well.  I played “Versus” challenges for a bit last night online.  Unfortunately I didn’t do as well as I had hoped.  There are some top notch players out there.  Online play was fun but the game play was a bit choppy.  I couldn’t tell if the performance problem was caused by my DSL line or if the problem was coming from the DOA4/Live servers.  I need to check the forums to see if other DOA4 players are experiencing the same choppiness.  I have not noticed any performance problems with other Xbox Live enabled games so I have to believe it is not my DSL line.<br /><br />Another feature I like about DOA4 is Sparring Mode.  There is a feature within this mode called Exercise, which is a great way to learn all the button combinations for a given character.  I will definitely spend more time in this mode to learn more of the advance moves and combinations.<br /><br />Overall, DOA4 is great.  The graphics are amazing.  The game play is fun.  The leaderboards are addicting.  And online play is a blast.  <br /><br />Thanks Melanie for getting me this great game.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>2005 has come and gone, and man was it fast.  2005 was a very interesting year for me.  I learned a lot about running a software business and I have a better idea of what it means to be a self employed computer geek turned aspiring entrepreneur.  I have my success stories, made mistakes, changed directions, lost sleep, and spent more time with my wife.  Here’s a brief recap of 2005:<br /><br />Success Stories<br />- Release <a href="http://www.smtpdiagnostics.com/">White Peak Software’s first product, SMTPdiagnostics</a>.  <br />- Released 4 custom software solutions for customers.<br />- Elected Chapter President of <a href="http://www.iccanyc.org/">ICCA NYC Metro</a>.<br />- Met target revenue goals.<br />- Became more focus on where I want to take <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>.<br /><br />Mistakes<br />- Over obligating myself and my time.<br />- Lacking focus for the first half of the year.<br />- Did not release Beta version of Vertigo.<br />- A poor job of networking and keep in touch with customer.<br /><br />So what are my resolutions for 2006?<br /><br />2006 Resolutions<br />- Complete Vertigo version 1.0.<br />- Increase product revenue by at least 60%.<br />- Do a better job of staying in touch with customer.<br />- Do a better job of going to the gym.<br />- And find more ways to spend more time with my wife.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>December has been a very busy month for me and my wife.  We’ve had a lot going on, which is why I have been slow to post this month.  And no, I have not spent the entire month playing on the Xbox 360, although I wish I had.<br /><br />First the exciting news…We’re moving out of NYC!<br /><br />Yep, you read it here first.  We’re moving out of NYC at the end of January.  Melanie and I both love this city but we also want a life style that is hard to have in the city unless you are filthy rich.  And contrary to my family’s beliefs, living in Manhattan doesn’t mean you are rich and we are far from rich.<br /><br />So where are we moving to?  <a href="http://www.salemweb.com/">Salem, Massachusetts</a>.  I call it our “From Rainbows to Witches” move and if you know anything about where we currently live and where we are moving to you will know this is not a Wizard of Oz reference.<br /><br />We found a super nice apartment in Salem.  It’s actually a house but a portion of the first floor is used as office space for the church that is next door.  We have a small portion of the first floor, all of the second and third floors, and a small storage room.  This house is definitely larger than our small Manhattan apartment.  And for a faction of the cost too.  I’ll post pictures of the house in about a month.<br /><br />A number of other things have been keeping me busy in December too.  Migrating all my Visual Studio.NET 2003 (.NET 1.1) projects to Borland Developer Studio 2006 (C# Builder) has not gone as smoothly as I had hoped.  I’ll post my experience about this later, but I will say I absolutely love BDS.  Live templates are awesome and the IDE is very fast.  Aside from load time I find it more responsive than Visual Studio 2005, which is why I’m moving all my .NET 1.1 projects to BDS.<br /><br />I also spent a lot of time in December reviewing and evaluating specific features of Visual Studio 2005 and .NET 2.0.  There are some improvements I like such as <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2005/11/09/my_opinion_of_typed_data_sets_is_changing.aspx">typed data sets</a> but I’m finding my customers are slow to move to or have little interest at the moment in .NET 2.0.  So while I wish BDS 2006 had support for .NET 2.0 it doesn’t look like I will be doing any hardcore .NET 2.0 work anytime soon.  My focus will continue to be on Win32 and .NET 1.1.<br /><br />Happy holidays to everyone.</p>

    <p>I finally got my copy of <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 install and I have started using it day.  I love it and it is a huge improvement over Delphi 2005.<br /><br />Unfortunately the IDE crashed on me, but it did something really cool.  The exception was caught and I was given the option to send the error report to Borland’s Quality Central.  Not only that, but if you provide your BDN credentials you can track the report!  How cool is that!<br /><br />I’m happy to see this new level of commitment to quality.</p>
