    </h2>
    
    <p>I just read from the Xbox forums that the problem I am experiencing might be caused by the power supply connectors.  Apparently some believe there is <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/536098/ShowPost.aspx">residue on the metal and pins</a> preventing the power supply from send full power to the console.  I wiped down all exposed metal pieces.  Hopefully this will fix the problem.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Santa came early at the Turner house.  My Xbox 360 arrived this afternoon!  I was impressed by the size of the console but not so impressed by the size of the power supply.  It’s huge but I can live with that.<br /><br />Setup was easy.  It only took me a couple of minutes.  I powered on the console with the plan to convert my Xbox Live account to Gold before playing any games, but low and behold the video card crapped out.  Yep, that’s right.<br /><br />The box was on for less than 5 minutes when the video card crapped out.  The screen got fuzzy with red dots all over then thin black and white lines were displayed.  My first thought was the video card was fried.  I powered off the console and called support.<br /><br />I was put on hold so while I waited I decided to unplug the console, plug it back in, and try it again.  The console booted up fine and the video was okay.  Whew, maybe it was just a freak one-time video problem.<br /><br />I was still on hold with Microsoft Xbox support.  I decided to stay on hold while I worked my way through the network setup and Xbox Live account conversion.  Luckly I wasn’t experiencing any more hardware problems.  I did have some problems converting my Xbox Live account and had to do the process twice.  Microsoft could improve the conversion process user interface a bit, in my opinion.<br /><br />Still no hardware problems and still on hold with customer support.  20 minutes had past so I decided to drop in my first game, Amped3.  I decided to hang up the phone too.  2 minutes later, red dots everywhere!  The dang video card went crazy again!<br /><br />So my first impressions are not good based on the first 30 minutes or so.  I felt like I did yesterday when <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2005/11/22/let_down_twice_today_by_microsoft.aspx">I saw Microsoft demo pre-release version of Visual Studio Team Services on Launch Day and it did NOT work</a>.  I have been browsing the Xbox support forums and it seems others are having problems with their new Xbox too.  I’m glad I’m not alone but I’m very disappointed with Microsoft.<br /><br />After powering down the console, unplugging it, plugging it back, and powering it up again, I was finally able to play Amped3.  The next 40 minutes were problem free.  I’m heading out in a few minutes so I had to turn it off.  I think I will turn it back on while I’m gone to do a burn in test.<br /><br />I noticed the manufacturing date on my console is Nov 14 2005.  Barely a week ago and it makes me wonder if Microsoft ever performed a burn-in test on it.  Well, one thing I do know is if the video goes out one more time I’m returning the console and games.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I’m almost hesitant to say this but my Xbox 360 has been running problem free for the last 4.5 hours.  Maybe the residue problem was the cause.  Time will tell.  I plan to play the heck out of the Xbox 360 this holiday weekend.  I’ll make another status posting at the end of the weekend along with my reviews of Amped3, PGR, and Call of Duty 2.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Updated: I’ve gotten a lot of gaming time in (over 20+ hours) on my Xbox 360 and I have not experienced any new hardware problems.  I guess the problems I experienced on Day 1 were related to residue on the metal connectors of the power brick.  Also, I’m having a blast with Amped 3 and Call of Duty 2.  I’ll post my reviews of these games later.</span></p>

    </h2>
    
    <table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>In an earlier post I mentioned my disappointment with Microsoft for not including wincv.exe in the .NET Framework 2.0 SDK.  Like many developers I have found this tool to be very handy and I use it a lot.  But all is not lost.  WinCV.exe can be used with .NET 2.0.<br /><br />WinCV.exe has a config file called WinCV.exe.config identifying the assemblies loaded and exposed by the tool.  I modified the config file to include the .NET 2.0 assemblies.  Low and behold this worked.  I can now use WinCV.exe to examine class definitions for 2.0 classes.<br /><br />I recommend copying the WinCV.exe and WinCV.exe.config to a clean directory if you have .NET 1.1 and 2.0 installed on the same machine.  This way you can use one instance of WinCV.exe for .NET 1.1 and the other for 2.0.  You can declare the 2.0 assemblies in the same config file as the 1.1 assembly but this can lead to confusion when looking at the class definitions in WinCV.exe.  I like to eliminate confusion so I copied WinCV.exe and its config file to a different directory, which I use to browse 2.0 classes.  I use the instance at the default location to browse 1.1 classes.<br /><br />I have posted <a href="http://www.thecave.com/downloads/WinCV.exe.config.xml">the WinCV.exe.config file containing the 2.0 assembly declarations here</a>.  Note I had to rename the file stored on the web server to WinCV.exe.config.xml so ASP.NET would not block you from downloading it.  You will need to remove the .xml from the file extension or copy</td>
      <td>paste the XML if you are viewing it in the browser window.<br /><br />Lastly, for those of you wondering where you can find WinCV.exe, look in your Visual Studio 2003 install directory.  The default location is:<br /><br />C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\SDK\v1.1\Bin<br /><br />Kudos to the Microsoft developer who had the smarts to use a config file for WinCV.exe.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update</span>: The <b>WinCV.exe.config file posted above</b> has the  section needed to force WinCV.exe to run under .NET 2.0 when multiple versions of the .NET Framework are present on the same machine.  Thanks to Don Jayamanne for recommending the the  section setting.</td>

    </h2>
    
    <p>This is more of a rant then anything else but I gotta say it.  I’m really disappointed with Microsoft today.  It started at the NYC Product Launch event for Visual Studio 2005, SQL Server 2005 and BizTalk 2006.  <br /><br />Today’s event was a let down for me.  I have been to many similar Microsoft events over the years and have always left thinking “This was well worth my time.”  Today’s event was only worth my time because of the free giveaways.  The actual event itself was a let down and left me wondering if Visual Studio Team Services is really ready.<br /><br />For starters the demo of VSTS used a pre-RTM version.  This was a launch day event and pre-released software was demoed…WTF!  On top of that many of the features demoed did not work, presumably because the pre-RTM release was used.  Unit tests did not run, web tests did not run, load tests did not run, reports could not be displayed, and in certain cases bad practices were demoed such as saving the list of work items in SharePoint as an Excel spreadsheet.  I would not want my team working from a static list of work items when Foundation Server is installed and live information can be used.<br /><br />Disappointed with the event I decided to return to the office early to get some work done.  My plan for the rest of the day is to evaluate the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlbulkcopy.aspx">SqlBulkCopy class</a> for a customer.  I wanted to quickly see the class definition for SqlBulkCopy so I went to load <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq/archive/2004/10/20/245236.aspx">wincv.exe</a>.  <br /><br />For those of you who don’t know what wincv.exe is, it is a class viewer for the .NET Framework classes.  I often use it to identify property and methods names, which is faster using wincv.exe then the MSDN documentation.  But to my surprise wincv.exe is NOT included with the .NET Framework 2.0 SDK.  What gives?  I found it to be a very useful tool that I used on a regular basis.  Now it is gone.  Even the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sbey26hw.aspx">wincv.exe page</a> says it ships only with version 1.0 and 1.1 of the .NET Framework.  <br /><br />I have been using this tool for 4 years and I’m disappointed that I cannot continue using it with the new release of the framework.  Needless to say this adds to my disappointment in Microsoft today.  If only my Xbox 360 had arrived today.  Things might seem different.</p>

    <p>Recently I mentioned the RSS feed for this site had a bug in it.  The link for each blog item was incorrect.  The reason this happened is because I was using Blogger.com to generate the rss.xml file and Blogger had no way of knowing the link used on the site.  I finally fixed this today but it means Blogger is no longer generating the XML file.  It also means the URL to the RSS feed has changed.<br /><br />If you are reading this blog from an RSS-based aggregator you will need to update the URL for the feed.  The new URL is:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thecave.com/rss.aspx">http://www.thecave.com/rss.aspx</a></p>

        <a href="/2005/11/09/my-opinion-of-typed-data-sets-is-changing/">My Opinion of Typed Data Sets is Changing</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>Is there a place in the .NET development world for typed data sets?  I use to think resounding “No”.  I despised typed data sets ever since I was first exposed to them in a VB.NET training class back in 2001.  Actually, until last week I have not even looked at typed data sets since that class.  <br /><br />I love writing code so custom business entity and handed-rolled CRUD classes are a-okay with me.  But I’m starting to develop a change in opinion about typed data sets in .NET.  It all began last week when I started evaluation ADO.NET 2.0.<br /><br />First of all, loading data into a DataSet or DataTable is much faster in ADO.NET 2.0, night and day faster.  For instance, I ran a speed test that loads 1 million rows into a DataTable.  The test took just over 52 minutes to load the 1 million rows using ADO.NET 1.1.  The same test took only 27.36 seconds using ADO.NET 2.0.  Now that’s a performance improvement.  If you previously discard DataSet and DataTable because of performance reasons, you owe it to yourself to take another look at them in ADO.NET 2.0.<br /><br />A typed data set is nothing more than code generated by Visual Studio that inherits from the DataSet and DataTable classes, among others.  You can view a typed data set as nothing more than a set of generated business entity and CRUD classes.  Because typed data sets inherit from DataSet and DataTable, they share the same performance boost given to its parent classes.  But this alone did not convince me that typed data sets finally have a place in the development world.<br /><br />Visual Studio.NET 2005 really impressed me on how easy it is to now create a typed data set.  The wizards make it easy to associate your CRUD stored procedures to the table adapter, and you can just as easily extended the functionality to include adhoc queries and other non-CRUD stored procedures.  And Visual Studio will generate over 800 lines of code that handles concurrency checking and other ADO.NET best practices with a simple drag and drop action.  As much as I hate to say it, this is faster than writing your own business entity and CRUD classes.<br /><br />The invention of a type data set is about improving a programmer’s productivity and Visual Studio 2005’s implementation of typed data sets does just that.  It is one of the most productive ways I have seen to build data access and entity classes.  I will definitely consider using typed data sets in future .NET 2.0 work.</p>
