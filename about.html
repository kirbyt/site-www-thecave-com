<h2>About thecave.com</h2>

<p>thecave.com is my blog site. Who am I? I'm <a href="http://www.kirbyturner.com/">Kirby Turner</a>, a software engineer, author, and snowboard bum.</p>


<p>Since its beginnings in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19960901000000*/http://www.thecave.com">1996</a>, thecave.com has been a place to find tips on programming, although in recent years it has evolved into a personal blog site where I shares my thoughts, opinions, and rants with anyone willing to read my nonesense.</p>
