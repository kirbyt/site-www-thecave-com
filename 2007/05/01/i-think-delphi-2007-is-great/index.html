Not only that, Loreen Fornshell of CodeGear went above and beyond to assist in correcting the problems caused by Digital River.There is still room for improvement with Delphi.

But this initial offering from the newly formed CodeGear is not only rock solid (in my opinion) but shows that CodeGear is heading in the right direction.&lt;/div&gt;Note: It occurs to me as I type this blog entry that the person might be referring to Delphi for PHP.  I admit I do not share the same love towards Delphi for PHP as I do for Delphi 2007, but it is after all a version 1.0 product.  Visual Studio 2002 and .NET 1.0 wasn’t that great either.
