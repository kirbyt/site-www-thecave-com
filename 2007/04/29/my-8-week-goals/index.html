This means not only getting updates to Killink CSV out the door but making improvements on the marketing side.  Currently, my plans include a press release campaign and Google AdWords.  I also plan to do a better job monitoring conversion rates and web site traffic, something I have ignored over the last year and a half.My motivation level is high and will only get higher as sales increase.  But even with a high level of motivation I must do a better job managing my time during the next 8 weeks.  I’ve been working 14 days recently and it’s starting to wear on me…and on my wife too.
