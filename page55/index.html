    </h2>
    
    <p>Over the last month a lot of my time has been spent focusing on security as I design a security framework and strategy for a customer.  One comment I hear often is “we don’t need to worry about internal security threats” or “internal security threats are minor and represent a low priority”.  I couldn’t disagree more and have been repeatedly emphasizing the importance of protecting ones assets from internal attacks, which for some companies is a greater threat.
<br />
<br />Yesterday’s <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1616668,00.asp?kc=ewnws062404dtx1k0000599">report</a> of an AOL software engineer being arrested for stealing 92 million customer screen names proves my point.  Some people will do crazy things when offered enough money.  And companies that believe “it won’t happen here” or “our employees would never do such a thing” are fooling themselves.  Why risk it?  Invest in reducing security threats, both external and internal.</p>

Actually this patent sounds interesting.  I can see how wearable devices can benefit from a personal area network.</p>

    <p>My friend Phil was in town this week which means one thing.  Time for <a href="http://www.benzonaband.com/">BenZona</a> to rock <a href="http://www.lunalounge.com/">Luna Lounge</a>.  They had a great gig last night and it was good to see Phil, Keith and others again.  We also stuck around to hear San Francisco based <a href="http://www.candyfromstrangers.com/">Candy From Strangers</a> who I definitely got into.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/12/1379.aspx">agree</a> with Scott.  Unit Testing support should be included with all versions of Visual Studio 2005 and not just with Team System.  However, I am not sure I agree with the unit testing support using a new framework developed by Microsoft.  <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> is here today and works with all released versions of the .NET Framework.  And I am sure support for version 2 of the .NET Framework will be included in NUnit once Microsoft has released it.<br /><br />I doubt many of my customers will be ready to move to VS.NET 2005 and the .NET Framework 2.0 when it is released, but I will still be developing solutions for them.  And I will continue to provide unit tests for custom written production code.  So while I agree that all versions of Visual Studio.NET 2005 should include support for unit testing, I would like to see stronger support for NUnit and not some new testing framework.  This will help ease the migration to the new tool and framework.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    <p>For those new to Firefox, be sure to check out the list of <a href="http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/">extensions</a>.  They’re easy to install and there are many helpful extensions that will improve your browsing experience.  As a matter of fact, I’m using the BlogThis! extension right now to post this entry.</p>

        <a href="/2004/06/17/firefox-0-9-available-for-download/">Firefox 0.9 Available for Download</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>While nothing really new, other than security updates has happened to IE in quite some time, Mozilla has continued work on its next generation web browser called Firefox.  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox 0.9</a> is available for download and I feel it is a worth while download.<br /><br />I have been running Firefox as my default browser for the last 24 hours.  I really like tab browsing and how Firefox blocks pop-up windows.  It works fine for almost all sites I visit including a Microsoft SharePoint Window Services 2.0 site that I use daily.  I don’t get the drop down command list on SharePoint documents like I would in IE but I’m still able to do everything I need with a document through the document design page.<br /><br />My only complaint to date is when I attempt to open a link in a new window from SharpReader, the RSS aggregator I use.  For some reason the web page is displayed in both a Firefox window and an IE window.  I doubt this is the fault of SharpReader and is more the fault of the IE component used within SharpReader.  In other words, I think the IE component is launching the additional IE window when Firefox is set as my default browser.<br /><br />Aside from that one problem, I enjoy browsing with Firefox based on my 24 hour experience and will probably keep it as my default browser for a while.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Microsoft has published the latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vssmap.asp">Visual SourceSafe Roadmap</a>, which outlines where VSS is heading with the release of Visual SourceSafe 2005.  The new version will still be geared towards individual developers and small teams, i.e., teams with less than 5 developers but it will finally include remote access.  I’m glad to see VSS is finally getting a much needed upgrade but I doubt the new release will convince me to switch back from <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    <p>A friend pointed me to <a href="http://www.bindingpoint.net/">BindingPoint</a>, which is an XML web services directory.  I did a quick search on <a href="http://www.bindingpoint.net/services.aspx?tag=srch&amp;val=snow+report&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">“snow report”</a> and found my snow report web service.  I checked out the service description that I setup in UDDI over a year ago and ran the quick test from BindingPoint.  It brought back memories of my <a href="http://www.uddi.org/">UDDI</a> and Web services work I did last year.  And I still think UDDI rocks!<br /><br /><br /></p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Apple’s new <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirPort Express</a> sounds simply amazing.  It can act as a wireless bridge, provides wireless access to USB printers, and play music broadcasted wirelessly from your computer.  The device fits in the palm of your hand and it has a built-in AC adaptor meaning no cables or power supply.  This little puppy will be great to take on the road too.  You can connect it to the hotel’s ethernet and access the Internet wirelessly.  Or use it at the home of friends and family who have broadband Internet access but no wireless access point.  I might have to buy one once Apple starts shipping it.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    <p>Microsoft recently <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/about/features-messenger.htm?level1=enushome&amp;level2=ad1&amp;level3=messengeralerts">announced</a> MSN Alerts for Xbox Live users.  It works by linking your Messager account with your Xbox Live gametag.  You can receive alerts for game invites, friend requests, know when friends sign in, and more.  Sounds cool but unfortunately I use <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a> as my IM client.<br /><br />Trillian is awesome in that it is a single IM chat interface for different IM services such as AIM, Messager, ICQ, and Yahoo.  With Trillian I no longer need to run different IM programs.  Instead I run one program and it communicates with the different services.  The only beef I have with Trillian is the lack of support for <a href="http://alerts.msn.com/">MSN Alerts</a>, but I’m sure that has more to do with Microsoft then with the Trillian folks.  And as much as I like the concept of MSN Alerts I’m not going to give up Trillian.<br /><br /><br /></p>
