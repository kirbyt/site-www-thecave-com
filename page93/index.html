        <a href="/2002/07/16/software-development-is-about-making-the-end-users-life-easier/">Software development is about making the end user's life easier.</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>I am starting to realize there are different types of software developers.  I guess I have always known this but it was not clear to me how the differences affect delivery of software solutions.  This probably explains why I am happy on some gigs and frustrated on others.  And why I can easily become frustrated on projects where I start out happy.
<br />
<br />As Joel Spolsky says, there are <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FiveWorlds.html">five worlds</a> of software development: shrinkwrap, internal, embedded, games, and throwaway.  I come from the shrinkwrap world where programs should have easy to use interfaces, be easy to install and deploy, and resilient to variations between computers.  After all, shrinkwrap applications are expected to be used “in the wild” by a large number of people.  Developing shrinkwrap applications requires a mindset not commonly found in the corporate and consulting worlds.  And with this different mindset comes a different way to work towards achieving the goals.
<br />
<br />I’ll pick on my buddies at <a href="http://www.antennasoftware.com/">Antenna Software</a> for a moment.  Now in their defense, I will say I left Antenna over a year ago and a lot has changed in that time.  My comments here are based on my time at Antenna as an employee.
<br />
<br />Antenna had the dream to be an <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/ISV.html">ISV</a> focused on mobile and ASP-based solutions for the field force automation.  In my mind to be successful we had to think like those companies producing shrinkwrap and embedded applications.  However the software engineering team was staffed with primarily people either recently out of college or from a corporate IT background.  The college guys are okay because you can shape and mold them but the corporate folks are a different story.  And I believe this contributed to the lack of a solid product after my one year at Antenna.
<br />
<br />A lot of assumptions can be made when you are developing applications that only run within a single company.  It is easier to demand certain restrictions or hardware configurations.  And deployment can be more involved.  It can be tough for most ex-corporate developers to make the switch from controlled environment programming to programming for the wild, which leads me to my current thought and reason for this post.
<br />
<br />I work in the consulting world of software development.  I like the freedom it provides and will probably remain a consultant for the rest of my career.  But most of the projects that consultants work on are custom software development for a single corporation.  There are exceptions from time to time like the work I did last year at <a href="http://www.i-deal.com/">i-Deal</a>, which was an internal software development effort turned commercial Web-based software.  But for the most part consulting gigs are on internal software development efforts.
<br />
<br />In my career I have observed an interesting fact.  When I apply shrinkwrap techniques and approaches for delivering an internal software solution the customer tends to be happier and the solution is perceived as having a higher level of quality.  Working in this manner will not make the software developer’s life easier.  In fact, it is harder for the developer and requires more work.  But software development is not about making the developer’s life easier.  It’s about making the end user’s life easier.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>As some already know, my grandmother Dot passed away last week.  I left for Memphis as soon as I heard the news to be with the family.  Although it is sad that Dot is no longer with us, she is in a much better place now.
<br />
<br />Dot was an amazing woman and a wonderful grandmother.  I still have fond memories of summer times at her place with a frig packed with Jell-O, Easter Saturday dying eggs, and nights playing Aggravation and watching Carson.  I can’t think of a better person to have as a grandmother.  I love you, Dot.</p>

    <p>I just finished the latest in Microsoft C# beta exams, 71-315 Develop and Implementing Web Applications with Microsoft Visual C#.NET and Microsoft Visual Studio.NET.  The test was easier than the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2002_06_01_archive.aspx#85194835">last one</a> but still had challenging questions.  Those planning to take this exam should have a working knowledge of Web app setup projects, security settings via the web.config, working with DataList, Repeater, and DataGrid server controls, how to write custom user controls, and once again ADO.NET, some XML, and how to consume Web services.
<br />
<br />And yes, for those wondering…I rescheduled the exam so I could take it this morning in Memphis.</p>

        <a href="/2002/07/08/back-from-vermont-2/">Back from Vermont</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>Melanie and I have returned to the Big Apple after a 4 day trip through the green mountain state of Vermont.  We started the road trip with a drive up the west side of the state ending at <a href="http://www.gostowe.com/">Stowe</a>.  On the way we took a sneak peek at the <a href="http://www.madriverglen.com/">Mad River Glen</a> ski slopes.  The scenery was wonderful with views of lakes and green mountains all around.  We ended the night with a 4th of July firework show in Stowe.  Don’t be fooled by this small town.  The firework show could easily rival big city firework shows.  For those wondering, we spent our nights at <a href="http://www.threebearsbandb.com/">Three Bears at the Fountain</a>, a truly wonderful Vermont B&amp;B.;
<br />
<br />The next day we drove out to Burlington to see Lake Champlain.  Burlington is a cool college town.  Interesting people walking the streets and again nice scenic views.  We left Burlington to return to Stowe via Smuggler’s Knot.  What a cool drive!  Large rocks, big trees, and some very tight turns that made driving a bit scary at times.
<br />
<br />We explored more of Stowe the next day.  We checked out the ski slopes and hiked down a blue run on Mt Mansfield.  Riding the slopes is still a better way for getting down though.  We did a little shopping and got some great deals on some ski/boarding wear.  And we ended our visit of Stowe with Melanie kicking my butt at miniature golf.
<br />
<br />From Stowe, we headed down to <a href="http://www.killington.com">Killington</a> where we stayed at the <a href="http://www.birchridge.com/">Birch Ridge Inn</a>.  Our dinner at the Inn was excellent.  We highly recommend it to all Killington visitors.  After picking up Melanie’s skis, checking out the Killington slopes [yes, we are obsessed], and a drive through Killington to see homes, we headed back to NYC.
<br />
<br />Our scenic drive home took us through the southwest corner of Vermont.  Unfortunately we could not see much because of the smoky haze.  We later learned the hazy was caused by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/07/07/canada.forestfires.ap/index.html">forest fires</a> in Canada.  This was followed by a lengthy drive in traffic between Albany, NY and NYC.  This 2 hour drive took us only 4 hours.  East Coast holiday travel by car can suck at times, especially returning home.
<br />
<br />Overall the road trip was great.  Vermont is great.  And Melanie is great.  I can’t wait until we return.</p>

Melanie and I are driving up to <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?zoom=2&amp;mapdata=b2d68tAsVaFv0L5HBfqIXjr47QsQxfIar7sm2ve3LBV1yyD9idZNXPb%2fh%2bjqdMRGlvSa7HhCKWAI%2bZOc7e2YhMF177pWgfzSftcJn93SKoxbhpXQFvXy7FEtm8MnffZOJUOAvLY%2fm3PdgEWpMceO3Tz2bUucMiVOyokh8l4YfRHJ0XbbHCUY6ASII5zt03615UQjUokAQtAoEfa%2b1pVE9%2fg2QwDIIhJLG4ZWLD5RjgFTlQAwikmxRDdUodWqbRelva0nvzX9XnKO1lfOXHmuQA%3d%3d">Stowe, VT</a> for the holiday weekend.  And no we are not leaving the city because of the various terrorist threats.  We are leaving town because we have a 4 day holiday and I have wanted to see Vermont in the summer time for a very long time.
<br />
<br />If we have time and are able, I will post entries about our trip but don’t count on it.  I am hoping for a geek-free weekend.</p>
