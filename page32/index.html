    </h2>
    
    <p>Some days I find it hard to stay focused.  There are many new technologies to play with and I want to spend time with them all.  I’m itching to install the latest version of <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> and see what has changed in the last year.  I also want to port a web part I wrote for SharePoint from C# to <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi/">Delphi</a> and make it a DNN module.  There’s also a few Ajax frameworks I want to experiment with, and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html">GData</a> (Google Data API) is something I’m really, really anxious to play with.<br /><br />The fun doesn’t stop there.  Microsoft’s Windows Workflow Foundation and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) are peaking my interest too.  /n software isn’t helping my focus problem either by releasing a new <a href="http://www.nsoftware.com/workflow/">workflow</a> and <a href="http://www.nsoftware.com/ssis/">SSIS</a>.  Just more fun stuff to play with.<br /><br />Maybe I need a new <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> company policy allowing 8 hours per week to “technology play time”.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I was hoping to make one more trip to Killington this season before packing away the snowboard, but it doesn’t look like it going to happen.  Killington announced today it will close on May 1st for the 2005-2006 season.  Looking at recent pictures I’m surprised they are able to stay open that long but Killington does have its image of staying open longer than any other East Coast resort to keep.  <br /><br />What a crappy season the East Coast had this year.  Here’s hoping there will be much more snow next season.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>My wife and I went to Fenway the other night to see the Redsox play.  It was our first visit to Fenway.  I like the stadium despite the small size.  As a matter of fact, I said to me wife I felt like we were at a minor league game because of the stadium size.  Plus, the stadium seems to be very family friendly with a kid throwing the first pitch and a kid making the standard “Play ball!” announcement.  The vibe and stadium size reminded me of the two minor league teams in New York.  However, that opinion changed once the game got started.  The crowd definitely fills the stadium with cheers and you definitely feel like you are at a major league game once the first pitch is thrown.<br /><br />Boston fans are definitely loyal fans.  But unlike St. Louis where just about every wears red, Boston fans have no one color.  Sure the Redsox fans are wearing some type of Redsox shirt but some shirts are blue, some are white, some are red…I even saw a green Redsox shirt.  Go figure.  One of the things I like about going to a Cardinals game in Busch stadium is seeing the sea of red.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, I thought the ticket prices were reasonable and definitely cheaper than a Yankees game.  Granted I paid for my tickets through the normal channel and I didn’t get ripped off by some scalper selling a $40 ticket for $150.  The food is also cheaper at Fenway compared to Yankee Stadium.  The only thing that was more expensive is the beer.<br /><br />Fenway charges way too much for beer.  Yes, a beer at Yankee stadium will run you something like $8 but it is twice the size of the wimpy $6 beer at Fenway.  So by the end of the game we spent as much as we would at Yankee stadium but that was only because we had to buy more beers at Fenway than we typically do at Yankee Stadium.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I upgrade my server install of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/gsx/">VMware GSX Server</a> with <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMware Server</a>, a free virtualization product for Windows and Linux currently in beta.  The VMware Server install went smoothly.  It detected the GSX install and uninstalled it for me.  It copied the appropriate settings over to VMware Server and my virtual machines were up and running again in a matter of minutes.  <br /><br />VMware Server is an improvement on GSX Server.  Most notable improvement is that it works with virtual machines created with VMware Workstation 5.x.  No more hacking the .vmdk file to make it work with GSX.</p>

    <p>I’ve been working away the last few weeks on a new web service SOA testing tool.  However, today I decided to take a break and see what else is happening in the world.  One of the things I played with today is Google Calendar.  It’s pretty cool and I think I will try it out for the next few weeks.  <br /><br />Google Calendar got me thinking about synchronizing my calendar, which is currently stored in Outlook, with Google Calendar.  This lead me to the <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google API</a> at http://code.google.com/.  The API uses REST principals with Atom and RSS feeds.  Now I have even more fun things to play with.</p>

        <a href="/2006/04/05/xml-schema-object-model-som-parser-for-delphi/">XML Schema Object Model (SOM) Parser for Delphi</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>I’m working on a new project and have a need to parse XML Schemas found inside WSDL documents.  After a few google searches I discovered the concept of a Schema Object Model (SOM).  The <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/04/som.html">.NET Framework has a SOM parser</a> as does <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/xmlsdk/html/85b447ee-70d0-4456-9ad7-70b4e2d1f3fa.asp">MSXML</a>.  There’s also a <a href="https://xsom.dev.java.net/">SOM parser for Java</a> as well.  Because I’m writing a Win32 application, I started learning <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=31360&amp;seqNum=1">the ins and outs of MSXML’s SOM parser</a>.  As a learned more I did additional google searches and discovered Delphi has its own SOM parser.<br /><br />Interfaces such as <i>IXmlSchemaDoc</i> and functions such as <i>LoadXMLSchema</i> and <i>LoadXMLSchemaStr</i> are undocumented but the source can be found in <i>source\win32\xml\XMLSchema.pas</i>.  There is also <a href="http://codecentral.borland.com/Item.aspx?id=21870">sample code for parsing an XML Schema</a> available BDN.  With the aid of the sample code I was able to get my sample project working.  <br /><br />And in case you are wondering, the VCL library has a component called <i>TXMLSchemaDoc</i> that wraps Delphi’s SOM parser into a handy component.  You will not find it in the tool pallet though.  For what it is worth, I found working with the interface (<i>IXmlSchemaDoc</i>) easy and I have not tried the <i>TXMLSchemaDoc</i> component.</p>

    <p>Ever wonder how much money WinZip brings in per year, or how much money Jasc, makers of Paint Shop Pro, makes annually?  Corel now owns these two and Corel is planning to go public, which means disclosure to this information.  <br /><br />Thomas Warfield over at A Shareware Life has <a href="http://www.asharewarelife.com/2006/04/winzip_and_jasc.html">posted the numbers</a> and a link to the entire prospectus.  Give it a quick read and see that shareware stars do make big money.  At least these two do.</p>
