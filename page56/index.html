    </h2>
    
    <p>It seems that a binding formatter is called twice when a user leaves a textbox control. As the user leaves the control the Leave event for the control is fired followed by the binding format event. The setter method of the bounded property is called next followed by the getter method then finally the binding format event is called again.</p>

    <p>Melanie and I were planning to fly into Manchester, NH next week and drive to Vermont for a break from NYC.  However confusion set in when we started checking the fly availability and car rentals.  Flights into Manchester are filling up and car rentals are sold out.  What gives?
<br /> 
<br />Duh!  The Democratic Convention 2004 starts on Sunday, July 26 in Boston.  No wonder Manchester is so busy that weekend.  Needless to say, Melanie and I are breaking convention (no pun intended) and driving up from NYC to avoid the Boston/Manchester madness.

        <a href="/2004/07/15/to-data-bind-or-not-to-data-bind-that-is-the-question/">To Data Bind or Not To Data Bind?  That is the Question.</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>I had a lengthy discussion with another developer today regarding data binding in .NET.  I started thinking about this more after the conversation ended and I realized there are some who think data binding should always be used in Windows based .NET applications.  The conversation today brought back memories of how developers overused data binding when VB 3.0 was released into the wild.
<br />
<br />Data binding in .NET is a vast improvement over past attempts at providing a data binding feature in a programming language.  I for one love the fact that I can data bind to different data structures and that I am not limited to binding to ADO.NET datasets only.  I often use data binding in my ASP.NET applications that use a repeater.  This feature alone has helped me build web pages faster, but I do not believe data binding is the silver bullet for all cases of moving data between structure and presentation.
<br />
<br />Consider a case where you are developing a Windows application and the presentation tier works with custom data structures only, no dataset.  The window must allow the user to edit values stored within the data structure.  One easy way to do this is to bind the data structure to the window elements.  Changes in the data will immediately be reflected in the data structure.  Now assume that the user wishes to cancel the data changes.  Unfortunately the data structure has already been updated with the changes.  How do you reset the data structure?
<br />
<br />There are probably 101 ways to solve this problem.  One approach that works well and does not use data binding is to copy data from the data structure into the window elements for display and copy the data back from the window elements to the data structure for persistence.  This is accomplished by writing two private methods, one to copy from the data structure to the window elements and the other to copy from the window elements to the data structure.  The on change event from each editable window element can be wired to a single event handler that sets a flag that indicates data has changed, i.e., IsDirty.
<br />
<br />Within the form load event of the window, the private method to copy data from the structure to the window elements is called.  Within the form close event or some other event indicating a desire to save the data, the private method to copy the data from the window elements to the data structure is called.  The flag indicating data has changed can be used here to avoid copying data when no changes exist.  In other words, only copy the data from the window elements if the IsDirty flag is true; otherwise do not copy the values.
<br />
<br />This approach does require the developer to write code.  Data binding would of course eliminate the need to write the code but in doing so you give up some flexibility in what you can and cannot do.  In many more complex solutions, giving up that flexibility can lead to more costly problem solving approaches such as writing code for workarounds to problems caused by the loss of flexibility.  This can be true when data binding is used. 
<br />
<br />I have seen projects that use data binding go down the path of writing various parsers, formatters, utility helper classes, implementing interfaces such as IEditableObject on data structures, and so on just to overcome limitations imposed by the use of data binding.  In the attempt to avoid writing code that follows a straight forward pattern of moving data from a structure to window elements and back, the project developers have made life much harder for themselves.  Design meetings, whiteboard sessions, and developer time are wasted on producing these workarounds just to eliminate the need to write simple snippets of clean code within the window.
<br />
<br />Data bind has its place in the application development world, but do not assume it is the only approach to use within your applications.  Don’t be afraid to write code.  You might be surprised at how easy it is to maintain, enhance, and most importantly improve the richness of your applications when you don’t use concepts like data binding.  And when you do use data binding use it wisely.

    </h2>
    
    <p>I received my new Dell Latitude 600 today.  Sweet machine but now it’s time to set it up to my liking.  My plan going into it is to setup the host OS with the general tools I need each day such as Eudora Pro, Office 2003, iTunes, and so on.  I will use either VMWare or Virtual PC to host guest OS for my development environments.  I plan to setup the primary user account for each OS with minimum privileges to force me to become even more security minded.
<br />
<br />I’m still not convinced that hosting my development environment in a guest OS is the right choice but I do like the idea of creating a new development environment in a matter of minutes instead of hours.  The big decision I have to make though is whether to use VMWare or Virtual PC.  I have been a VMWare user for some time now but there are some cost benefits for using Virtual PC.  Post a reply if you have an opinion on VMWare versus Virtual.  Meanwhile I’ll post more about my setup and configuration experience as I go through the process.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>“This is a warning for any creator of computer programs: that software quality matters, that applications must be foolproof, and that-whether embedded in the engine of a car, a robotic arm in a factory or a healing device in a hospital-poorly deployed code can kill.”
<br />
<br />This quote comes from an article my friend Matt pointed to me from Base Line Magazine titled <a href="http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,1397,1543564,00.asp">Why Software Quality Matters</a>.
<br />
<br />This article really illustrates the importance of software quality.  As more software is used in the daily lives of people the importance of quality software increases.  Recently I read in Consumer Reports that a particular model of luxury car is being recalled due to a problem related to a transmission controller chip.  The software in this chip can cause the car moving forward to shift into reverse.  Imagine the pileup that could be caused by a car suddenly shifting into reverse as it and other drivers speed down the NJ Turnpike during rush hour.
<br />
<br />Many programmers like me can and have argued that our business applications pose no threat to human life.  But does this mean we can set quality levels for our work to a lower standard?  Does it mean we can intentionally deploy poorly written applications?  I say absolutely not!  Software developers must start accepting the responsibility of writing high quality code and they should be held accountable for any code not adhering to a high standard of quality.</p>
