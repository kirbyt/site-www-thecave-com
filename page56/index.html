    <p>I will be out of the office through Monday.  I’m backpacking with my friend Shawn in the backcountry of Arizona.  Day time temps around 115+ degrees.  I’m not looking forward to that, but the rest of the adventure should be fun.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>A recent <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.157898">thread</a> on the Business of Software discussion forum criticizes FogCreek’s latest project as being simple and something that is easily implemented by an India student for a personal web sites.  Personally I think simple software is the better software when it comes to commercial software.<br /><br />When I see a commercial software product that has me thinking “That is so simple I could implement it myself,” it typically turns out to be a very good product.  And experience has taught me that such an application is not always easy to implement.  <br /><br />A pro snowboarder makes riding look so simple.  He or she floats on the snow effortlessly making perfect turns and controlling the board as if the board were an extension to his or her own body.  In reality carving the perfect turn takes skill.  And writing commercial software that looks so simple any programmer could implement it also takes skills.<br /><br />Writing software for personal use is one thing, but writing software that is thrown into the wild and still looks simple to implement is a much harder challenge.  Commercial software has to take into account many more variables than personal or in-house software.  This fact alone makes the software harder to implement, and let’s not forget more time consuming.<br /><br />Don’t believe me?  Just try re-writing that simple application and see what kind of effort it really takes.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I want to include a legend feature in SMTP Diagnostics to give users a clue as to the meaning of various icons used in the program.  I initially tried to accomplish this by creating a new borderless window that displayed the legend.  When the user clicked the legend link in the statusbar the legend window would popup.  But I found an easier way to do this.<br /><br />Instead of creating a new window and doing all the leg work behind the scenes to display the window, position the window, add shadowing to the window and so on, I decided to use a WinHelp popup.  WinHelp popups are used in many applications such as Microsoft Office to display “What’s This?” Help.  A nice feature of WinHelp popups is content can be formatted.  In the case of SMTP Diagnostics, a WinHelp popup topic is used to display the legend with the icon on the left followed by the text describing the meaning of the icon.<br /><br />The end result.  I reduced the code used in my first attempt at displaying a legend to a single line of code.  Delphi and WinHelp do all the work of displaying, positioning, and shadowing the legend window.<br /><br /><a href="/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot03.jpg"><img src="/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot03.jpg" border="0" width="380" height="331" /></a><br />Click image to enlarge.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>For the last 24 hours I have tracked incoming spam to my email address.  During that time I received a total of 225 spam messages.  163 of these messages were properly filtered on the server as spam, but unfortunately 62 spam messages were not caught by the server.  This means I need to tweak the server settings more.  At one time my server caught approximately 90% of incoming spam which no longer seems to be the case.<br /><br />Good news is 54 of the 62 spam messages were caught by my email client.  The other good news is I am seeing a major reduction in total spam received since I started <a href="/archive/2005/06/25/masking_addresses_to_prevent_email_harvesting.aspx">masking my email address</a>.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I’ve been heads down all day working on SMTP Diagnostics.  I did more work on the print preview, added an icon legend, and started work on the help file.  The help file is probably 70% complete.  Hopefully I can get the Chief Content Editor for White Peak (a.k.a., my wife Melanie) to review the help file this weekend.<br /><br />I feel the app is ready for public release but I still have a number of “administrative” tasks to complete before I can release it.  For instance SMTP Diagnostics still does not have a home page, and I need to setup the web store so users can purchase a license.  I hope to have these things in place within the next couple of weeks.<br /><br />Shoot me an email if you are interested in reviewing the preview release.</p>

This gives me a few days to check my Junk Mail folder should someone report sending me an report that was mistakenly flagged as MEDIUM or HIGH.<br /><br />To setup the auto-clean, go to Settings</td>

    </h2>
    
    <p>It’s been 48 hours since I changed e-mail to email and the winner is “email”.  It seems the google will search for both “e-mail” and “email” when “email” is used in the search string.  However, it will only search for “e-mail” when “e-mail” is used in the search string.  Based on this I will stop using the dash when I write the word email.<br /><br />On a related note, I found google has index the wrong page on my site when searching the phrase “Masking Addresses to Prevent Email Harvesting”.  It has indexed the page www.whitepeaksoftware.com/blog.aspx?xml/2005_06_01_archive.xml but I assumed it would have indexed the page <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/archive/2005/06/25/masking_addresses_to_prevent_email_harvesting.aspx"> http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/archive/2005/06/25/masking_addresses_to_prevent_email_harvesting.aspx</a>.  Go figure.<br /><br />Also, I wonder how google will index my blog entries given that each entry is available from thecave.com and whitepeaksoftware.com.  Time will tell.</p>
