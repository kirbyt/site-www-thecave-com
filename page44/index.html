        <a href="/2006/02/08/brand-x-delphi/">Brand X Delphi</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>The blogosphere is buzzing with the latest Borland news, and one common theme is “Who keeps the Borland name and branding?”  It looks like the Borland name will stay with the ALM company while the development tools will be branded under the new company.  <br /><br />My first reaction to this was that the development tools should keep the Borland name.  After all, most people in the development community associate the Borland name with the development tools such as Delphi and JBuilder.  But after thinking about this a bit longer I’m starting to favor a new name.  Brand X Delphi might spark new interest in people who have given up on the Borland name.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>eWeek.com reports <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1922384,00.asp?kc=ewnws020806dtx1k0000599">Borland to Divest Dev Tools with Segue Buyout</a>.  This is definitely not a move I expected from Borland’s new CEO Tod Nielsen.  Borland made the announcement yesterday saying it <a href="http://www.borland.com/us/company/news/press_releases/2006/02_08_06_borland_acquires_segue_software.html">plans to seek a buyer for the Borland IDE product lines</a>, which include Delphi, C++ Builder, C# Builder, JBuilder, InterBase, Kylix, and more.<br /><br />Although I didn’t expect it, I think it is a good move.  Borland’s focus the last couple of years has been on its ALM business, which is no interest to me.  The idea that a new spin-off company will be created that will focus on development tools such as Delphi sounds like the right move to me.  And I was happy to read that <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/davidi/archive/2006/02/08/23013.aspx">David Intersimone, aka David I, will be joining the new dev tool company</a>.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>This blog site has been up since March 2002 and since that time it has never once received a spam comment posting.  That was until Tuesday of this week.<br /><br />The site gets lots of traffic.  Not as much as <a href="http://www.lemanix.com/nickblog/">this person</a> or <a href="http://blog.marcocantu.com/">that person</a>, but enough to make me happy.  I knew the day would come when a spammer would finally make a posting but I didn’t think it would take this long.  Now I’m not asking for spam comments to be posted on this site but I find it interesting it has taken almost 4 years before a spammer successfully posted comment.<br /><br />What makes this more interesting is that a number of attempts by spammers to post spam comments have been made over the last 4 years.  This is especially true for another site I have, the <a href="http://www.melanieandkirby.com/">Melanie and Kirby wedding site</a> where attempts by spammers to post comments in the guest book are made daily.<br /><br />So what’s my secret to warding off spammers?  I’m not 100% sure.  All my sites including this blog site are custom written using ASP.NET.  Maybe that has something to do with it.  What I do know is that I will probably start seeing an increase in successful spam comment posting to this site unless I make some changes.</p>

    <p>Last week I posted <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2006/01/16/why_no_free_personal_edition_of_borland_developer_studio.aspx">a few remarks on the lack of a free Personal or Trial Edition of Borland Developer Studio</a>.  A friend of mine wanted to give Delphi a try but unfortunately he cannot because Borland does not provide a way for him to do this.<br /><br />As it turns out on the same day Marco Cantu made a newsgroup and blog posting on the exact same topic.  And there were a number of replies from both sides regarding the issue, which I have included below.<br /><br />Still I think it is a mistake for Borland to not have a Personal or Trial version available for download available today.<br /><br /><a href="http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/perstrial_again.html">More of the topic from Marco Cantu</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.borland.com/abauer/archive/2006/01/18/22786.aspx">And a differ point of view.</a></p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>My wife and I have actually moved from New York City to <a href="http://www.salemweb.com/">Salem, Massachusetts</a>.  It’s still a bit surreal for us.  As we were driving out of the city yesterday, it didn’t feel like we were really leaving.  It felt more like we were making a quick trip and will be returning in a few days.  I think it will hit me in a few days that we’re not returning to the city to live.  Then again it might take longer for that to happen since I will be returning to New York next week for a meeting.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Today is our last full day in New York.  The movers arrive tomorrow at 8 AM.  We have almost everything packed.  We ran out of boxes last night so we couldn’t finish.  <br /><br />I’m not sure how soon we will have Internet access from the new home.  That’s one of my projects today…to schedule cable TV and Internet hook up.  So don’t expect a quick reply to emails and forum postings for the next few days.<br /><br />So how will we spend our final day in New York?  We have a few more things to pack, and the DVR/cable boxes need to be returned to Time Warner.  I’m meeting a good friend this afternoon for a quick happy hour drink followed by date night with my wife.  We are going to dinner at the place of our first date.  Unfortunately it won’t be a late night because the movers are coming early tomorrow but I’m sure it will still be a special time for us.<br /><br />I thought leaving New York was going to be hard, but as it turns out I’m ready to go.  The fact we spent our last weekend up in Vermont is probably a sign that we need to move.  We just don’t enjoy the city the way we use too, and there are so many other things we want out of life that are hard to obtain from here unless you have lots of money.  So it’s farewell to New York, hello Salem.</p>

    <p>The January 2006 issue of the online magazine Bitwise Magazine has a good <a href="http://www.bitwisemag.com/copy/reviews/software/programming/borland/bds2006.html">review of Borland Developer Studio</a>.  The reviewer makes some very good points, although I do not complete agree with one point, C# programmers will prefer Visual Studio.  As someone who also writes code in C# I prefer BDS over Visual Studio.  I’m more productive using a single IDE then using two separate IDE.  Using two separate IDE means I have to remember two sets of the hotkeys, how-to’s, and so on.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>A good friend of mine is interested in doing some Delphi programming for personal projects.  Unfortunately he has no way of using the latest release of Delphi without spending money on a new user license.  On the contrary, the hobbyist programmer who wishes to learn C# can download and use Microsoft’s Visual C# Express free of charge.  <br /><br />I’m always talking up the benefits of Delphi to my friends and I’m constantly telling other developers to give it a try.  But the sad reality is that those interested in looking at Delphi for the first time or the hobbyist slash student who wants to use Delphi for personal projects and to learn cannot without spending lots of dollars for a new user license.<br /><br />Get a clue Borland!  Make a Personal Edition free for those programmers who wish to learn more about Delphi or use it for personal projects.  And make it downloadable from your web site.  You will have more Delphi customers in the long run if you do.<br /><br />As for my friend, Borland has just lost a potential customer by not providing a freeware version Delphi.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update</span>: Seems I’m not the only one talking about the lack of a Personal Edition or trial version of Delphi.  <a href="http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/d2006trial.html">What about Delphi 2006 Trial and Personal?</a></p>
