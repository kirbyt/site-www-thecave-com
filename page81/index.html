    <p>Snowboarding out west is great, but there is something special about the New England area that seems to bring out the truly passionate…the freakin’ cold temperatures.  Stowe’s snow report for today says the high temps for the base is -10 degrees and the summit is an warmer -6 degrees!  Now that’s really, freakin’ cold.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Spent the weekend with Melanie and most of her family in Killington.  The snow was great.  Saturday we rode Killington.  It was very chilly with temps in the single digits and wind chill well below zero.  The close to 50 mph wind gusts were a lot of fun and almost pushed me over a few times.
<br />
<br />We went to Pico on Sunday.  Less wind and it felt a bit warmer.  But best of all was the snow conditions, which were beyond great!  I felt like I was riding out west at times.  The ungroomed blacks and glades were the places to be.  It was the perfect primer to my upcoming Whistler trip.</p>

    <p>We’re back from <a href="http://www.sundayriver.com/">Sunday River</a>, Maine where the snow was better than expected two out of the three days we were there.  Sunday River is a nice place to visit and we will definitely go back some day.  The trails are a lot of fun with lots of rolling slopes.  The black diamond runs are not too steep and the double blacks, while steeper, are typically short.  They make a lot of snow there when needed and do an excellent job grooming the trails.  There’s lots to explore and a few different terrain parks, although more park than I can handle.  All and all, Sunday River was a great place for Melanie and I to bring in the new year.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I was lucky enough to return to New York City at the tail end of the latest Noreastern to hit the Northeast part of the country.  Many flights were cancelled in and out of NYC airports but the plane I was on was one of the lucky ones allowed to land on the snow plowed runway.  Yeah! I am finally home for a few days.
<br />
<br />But the funny thing is that I was hoping to ride my freebord, which has still not seen the concret.  Guess I will have to wait a few more days freebording the streets of New York.  And I tell you I am jonesin’ to stand sideways and ride something.  So much so I was seen riding a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004S1SU/ref=cm_bg_f_1/102-4319086-5639357">lawn buddy cart</a> on the hill behind my aunt’s house in Mississippi on Christmas afternoon.  What fun!</p>

    <p>I am counting down the minutes to my departure from Jacksonhell, FL, and my return north to spend time with my squeeze and to once again ride the slopes of Killington.  Pico opened last weekend so we might hit it on Sunday.  I wonder what Beer Mountain is like this weekend.  Yes, I said it again…Beer Mountain.
<br />
<br />I wish there were a way to control time.  I would speed it up to the point where Melanie and I arrive in Killington then slow it down over the weekend so the time together seems to last forever.</p>

    <p>Met up with Melanie in DC for the Murphy’s holiday party.  Good times and good friends.  My friend Tom from Memphis joined us for the party, and long time friends from St. Louis now DC area residents Linda and Jeff stopped by for a while.  Always great seeing them.
<br />
<br />The traveling thing has Melanie and I really busy lately.  A typical 7 to 10 days will have both of us in up to 5 different cities.  For example, my schedule has me back in Jacksonville, FL on Monday, Killington, Vermont for the weekend, followed by Memphis, then NYC, and finally Sunday River, Maine.  Melanie will be home in PA, back to Killington, NYC, Paris, and Sunday River as well but I am not sure of the order of her schedule.  And next month is shaping up to be more of the same but with different destination cities.
<br />
<br />So see ya at the airport terminals…</p>

    <p>It’s time to call in sick.  Killington got 8 to 10 inches of fresh pow over night and it is still falling.  Stowe got 4 inches over night.  And the trees are starting to change colors here in Florida.  Something is not right.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I have return to rainy Florida after attending the first ever <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/home/tripdetail.wasted?tid=6">DGB Killington Weekend</a>.  What a great weekend!  Skiing and riding, beer and pizza.  What more can a group of guys ask for?
<br />
<br />We shredded slopes of Killington from peak to peak Saturday including Beer Mountain, and threw back a few cold ones at the Outback for apre’ ski.  We ended the night with a few rounds of <a href="http://www.playbeirut.net/">Beirut</a> where Team Andy and Josh took the first game only to be stomped by Team Fernado and Kirby, who were calling their shots and landin’ em in game two.  But the match would be won by Team Andy and Josh who were landing double sinkers and clearing the other end of the team in a matter of minutes.
<br />
<br />Sunday was a return to the Killington slopes with a smaller crowd and better snow conditions.  The snow was falling and there were wind gusts so strong that I almost fell over a couple of times.  Andy was slammed to the ground by an out of control snowboarder.  Fernado was working on technique.  And Josh and I were making plans to take out the other two on the lifts.
<br />
<br />Overall it was a great time with great guys.</p>
