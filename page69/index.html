    </h2>
    
    <p>So here I am flying back to New York.  I spoke at a Web services boot camp today in the Research Triangle of North Carolina.  A fun day, I must say.  But it got me thinking, and the first thought was that I don’t post enough technical content on this site.  Why is that?
<br />
<br />The main reason is most likely are result of a lack of excitement in technology with my job.  As a consultant, you sometimes have to work with less interesting technologies because of customer demand.  Lately that less interesting technology for me has been Microsoft SharePoint technologies.
<br />
<br />Now don’t get me wrong.  SharePoint version 2.0 is a nice offering, and I have been impressed with the ASP.NET implementation.  It is once again proof that some of the best and brightest minds work at Microsoft.  Unfortunately for me, to be involved with technology at a level that would interest me the most would mean relocating to the Seattle area.
<br />
<br />Relocating is not going to happen though, especially right now.  First and foremost, I love New York City.  And I love being close to the New England area, especially Vermont.
<br />
<br />So what is a technology starved individual like myself who gets terribly excited about technology of interest, like Web services and the Microsoft .NET Framework, to do?  Let me know if you can help me out.  I’m soul searching my career and I need guidance.
<br />
<br />And on a totally unrelated note, when can I start surfing the Net from the plane in a very cost effective way?  Wireless net access everywhere.  That’s the way life should be be.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I took the freebord out for another 30 minute while in Bryn Athyn for the weekend, and quickly learned that the hills were too big for me.  I did a nice concrete roll while trying to stop and I struggled to link turns.  The board is definitely harder to ride than a normal skateboard.  Speed is a good thing to have when learning to ride but too much speed is a bad thing.  I’ll probably buy elbow pads before trying it again in BA.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>New York City has ban smoking in the bars.  And although I think people should be free to smoke in public, I have to admit I enjoyed coming home from the bar last night not smelling of smoke.  Melanie said after returning “It was like not being at a bar” because either of us smelled.  I think I might be in favor of the ban after all.</p>

    <p>12 inches in Killington so far and it’s still snowing!  Why do I live so far away?  And why don’t I have a car?</p>

    <p>After months of collecting dust, my <a href="http://www.freebord.com/">freebord</a> finally hit the concrete today.  I tried it out for about 30 minutes along the bike path on the Hudson River.  It doesn’t quite feel like riding a snowboard (yet) but that’s probably because I wasn’t going fast enough.  I started with a short, small slope but quickly learned that I needed more speed to balance the board.  I found a steeper slope that was a bit longer that did the trick.  It was perfect for learning.  I’m not doing full carves yet but I’m able to balance and ride straight.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I spent the morning taking a deeper look at WS Security using Microsoft’s WSE and IBM WSTK.  Specifically I wanted to learn more about encrypting a SOAP message, and I have to say I am not only impressed with the standard but with the implementations from both Microsoft and IBM.  Once I resolved issues around my X.509 certificate, I was able to play.  I found it very easy to sign and encrypt my SOAP messages.  And on initial glance, it looks like interop between the two toolkits works well.
<br />
<br />If I have more time, I hope to play with WS Security more.  It’s an interesting spec.  Unfortunately it looks like I am about to spend the next few weeks learning SharePoint v2.0, something I’m not all to happy about.  Not that it is a bad product.  It actually looks good, but I’m just not interested in it.</p>

    <p>I thought about an interesting problem today.  Recently I updating the code behind this site so that all content is stored in XML.  But within the archive section, I have references to past posting that use the old URL.  These old URL now give a HTTP 404 error.  I have always thought it interesting when a site tries to determine the new URL for an old one.  I guess now I have a chance to try resolving that problem.  Hmmm, maybe I will look into doing that tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I should have watched that weather yesterday.  There were snow flurries in New York but I didn’t think about further north.  Killington got 4 inches, Stratton 3 to 4 inches, and Stowe got 6 to 8 inches.  Today would have been a good day to call in sick.</p>
