    <p>A friend pointed me to <a href="http://www.bindingpoint.net/">BindingPoint</a>, which is an XML web services directory.  I did a quick search on <a href="http://www.bindingpoint.net/services.aspx?tag=srch&amp;val=snow+report&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">“snow report”</a> and found my snow report web service.  I checked out the service description that I setup in UDDI over a year ago and ran the quick test from BindingPoint.  It brought back memories of my <a href="http://www.uddi.org/">UDDI</a> and Web services work I did last year.  And I still think UDDI rocks!<br /><br /><br /></p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Apple’s new <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirPort Express</a> sounds simply amazing.  It can act as a wireless bridge, provides wireless access to USB printers, and play music broadcasted wirelessly from your computer.  The device fits in the palm of your hand and it has a built-in AC adaptor meaning no cables or power supply.  This little puppy will be great to take on the road too.  You can connect it to the hotel’s ethernet and access the Internet wirelessly.  Or use it at the home of friends and family who have broadband Internet access but no wireless access point.  I might have to buy one once Apple starts shipping it.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    <p>Microsoft recently <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/about/features-messenger.htm?level1=enushome&amp;level2=ad1&amp;level3=messengeralerts">announced</a> MSN Alerts for Xbox Live users.  It works by linking your Messager account with your Xbox Live gametag.  You can receive alerts for game invites, friend requests, know when friends sign in, and more.  Sounds cool but unfortunately I use <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a> as my IM client.<br /><br />Trillian is awesome in that it is a single IM chat interface for different IM services such as AIM, Messager, ICQ, and Yahoo.  With Trillian I no longer need to run different IM programs.  Instead I run one program and it communicates with the different services.  The only beef I have with Trillian is the lack of support for <a href="http://alerts.msn.com/">MSN Alerts</a>, but I’m sure that has more to do with Microsoft then with the Trillian folks.  And as much as I like the concept of MSN Alerts I’m not going to give up Trillian.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I had an interesting chat with a team member today about which XML parsing API from the .NET Framework to use for a particular situation.  He mentioned that using the XPathNavigator with an XmlReader would not load the document into memory.  However, after some quick research I found this to be incorrect.  XPathNavigator is different than XmlDocument in that it is optimized for XSLT processing and the XPath data model, but it is similar in that the entire document is read into memory.  XPathNavigator appears to use a cursor-base model for traversing the document while XmlDocument uses a tree-base model.<br /><br />The rule of thumb I have come up with is this:  Read-only, forward-only XML parsing API tend to read from a stream and do not store the entire document in memory.  Random access XML parsing API, which typically use a tree-base model or cursor-base model, will traverse in-memory the XML document which means this entire document is stored in memory.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I have been using NUnit since its early days but it has only been in the last six months that I have made the move to test driven development.  TDD is concept of writing production code based on unit test cases that are written first.  And using a framework such as NUnit enables the developer to write automated unit tests that will test the features of an application at a functional level thus encouraging test driven development.  <br /><br />TDD is a paradigm switch for many developers as it was for me.  Sure I have been unit testing my code for years.  I would employ techniques such as console applications, shell programs, and other types of test harnesses to test the functions of my code.  But until recently I never <br />started the development of a module by writing unit tests first.<br /><br />Test driven development is an investment up front in the quality of your code.  That investment is in the form of the unit tests before production code.  Many developers today write the production code first (after the design phase of course), followed by commenting the code, then followed by testing the code.  And in many cases the later work of commenting and testing never happens because bug fixes become the developer’s top priority.  But by investing in the quality of the code at the start developers will find that bugs are reduced, the classes and functions of the code are better designed, and over all quality of the work is greatly improved.  Best of all, refactoring code becomes less of a risk with TDD because recursion testing at the unit level is possible.<br /><br />Here are some tip I would like to share that will hopefully help you make the move to test driven development:<br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Just do it.  Force yourself to write your unit test first.  Over time the quality of the unit test will improve, writing unit test will be easier, and it will because almost second nature for you to start with a unit test.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;When testing data changes to a database, start a transaction in the SetUp of the unit test and roll back the transaction in the TearDown.  This provides an easy way to clean up the data after each unit test.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Writing a unit test prior to writing the production code will give you insight into the design of your class or function.  Use this insight to improve on the design prior to writing production code.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Use <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/blog.aspx?xml/2004_06_01_archive.xml#108613701548157152">composite unit testing</a> to test implementors of interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Write a unit test for each defect reported.  This provides a great way to ensure a problem never reoccurs.  And for those who already have existing applications but no unit tests, this approach will give you an introduction to writing unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br /><br /></p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I just read an <a href="http://reviews-zdnet.com.com/AnchorDesk/4520-7297_16-5138088.html?tag=adts">article</a> about a new service called <a href="http://www.didtheyreadit.com/">DidTheyReadIt</a>.  In a nutshell, this service places a small Web bug in HTML formatted e-mails that acts as a tracking device.  When the e-mail recipient reads the e-mail a script on the DidTheyReadIt site logs the action.  It will even log how long it took to read the e-mail message.  Based on logged information the e-mail sender can know if you read the e-mail or not.  Fortunately this service only works with e-mail readers that support HTML formatted e-mails, which is something I have never liked.  Unfortunately most people view e-mail message as HTML.
<br />
<br />HTML e-mails look nice but too much can happen behind the scenes that the message reader does not know about such as tracking when the e-mail message was read.  I use <a href="http://www.eudora.com/">Eudora</a> as my preferred e-mail reader.  It allows me to turn off viewing e-mail as HTML.  I can still see the e-mail and read it, but it is not rendered as HTML.  This means the e-mail message might not look as nice but it also means there is no unknown activity happening behinds the scenes when I read the e-mail.  And I still have the option for view the message as HTML if I like.</p>
