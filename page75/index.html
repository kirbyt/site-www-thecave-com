My latest order of WASTED Wear arrived today.  The <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/wastedboarding.5440274">WASTED hoodie</a> rocks!  It’s comfy and the print job is nice.  Not as nice as the t-shirt given away in Whistler but still nice.  The golf shirt is okay but the logo is a little low for my liking.  And the shirt quality is only so so.  The <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/wastedboarding.5439853">baby doll shirt</a> looks good though.  Can’t wait for Melanie to try it on.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>My snowboard season is finally over, and it ends with me wanting more.  This weekend in Killington was one of the best times on the slope for me this season.  And to add to the great snow, the weekend was made a bit better by spending time with the Davis’s.  The turkey was delich and the ham was more than heavenly.  But this posting is about the snow.
<br />
<br />Saturday was overcast and warm with slope side temps in the 50’s.  The snow was soft with lots of nice banks on the bumps.  Saturday felt like surfing over and over without having to wait for the perfect wave.  The half pipe was surprisingly good given the warm weather and I almost made it to the top of the 15 foot wall more than once.
<br />
<br />Sunday was the best of the two days.  Sunny and warm.  Temps in the 60’s during the morning and accordingly the Killington snow report, in the 70’s during the afternoon.  Definitely t-shirt weather.  The surface condition was snow in most places, bare in others.  And there was also the occasional water puddle.  My favorite part of the day was smashing through soft bumps and face spraying myself with snow.
<br />
<br />I got 32 days on the slopes and Melanie made her record high of 27 days spread over a long, 5 month season.  Somehow Melanie and I missed the powder all season.  I felt like I was riding the same stuff all season, be it in Whistler or Killington.  But this weekend reminded me how much fun snowboarding is.  And it left me wanting more.  I can’t think of a better way to end the season.</p>

    <p>You know you travel too much when the Avis Car Rental bus driver can tell you which airline you are flying on before you can.
<br />
<br />Yep, this happened to me today.  And lucky for me he knew which airline because I may have tried flying out on American West instead of American Airlines.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>So here I am flying back to New York.  I spoke at a Web services boot camp today in the Research Triangle of North Carolina.  A fun day, I must say.  But it got me thinking, and the first thought was that I don’t post enough technical content on this site.  Why is that?
<br />
<br />The main reason is most likely are result of a lack of excitement in technology with my job.  As a consultant, you sometimes have to work with less interesting technologies because of customer demand.  Lately that less interesting technology for me has been Microsoft SharePoint technologies.
<br />
<br />Now don’t get me wrong.  SharePoint version 2.0 is a nice offering, and I have been impressed with the ASP.NET implementation.  It is once again proof that some of the best and brightest minds work at Microsoft.  Unfortunately for me, to be involved with technology at a level that would interest me the most would mean relocating to the Seattle area.
<br />
<br />Relocating is not going to happen though, especially right now.  First and foremost, I love New York City.  And I love being close to the New England area, especially Vermont.
<br />
<br />So what is a technology starved individual like myself who gets terribly excited about technology of interest, like Web services and the Microsoft .NET Framework, to do?  Let me know if you can help me out.  I’m soul searching my career and I need guidance.
<br />
<br />And on a totally unrelated note, when can I start surfing the Net from the plane in a very cost effective way?  Wireless net access everywhere.  That’s the way life should be be.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I took the freebord out for another 30 minute while in Bryn Athyn for the weekend, and quickly learned that the hills were too big for me.  I did a nice concrete roll while trying to stop and I struggled to link turns.  The board is definitely harder to ride than a normal skateboard.  Speed is a good thing to have when learning to ride but too much speed is a bad thing.  I’ll probably buy elbow pads before trying it again in BA.</p>

    <p>New York City has ban smoking in the bars.  And although I think people should be free to smoke in public, I have to admit I enjoyed coming home from the bar last night not smelling of smoke.  Melanie said after returning “It was like not being at a bar” because either of us smelled.  I think I might be in favor of the ban after all.</p>
