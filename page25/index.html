    </h2>
    
    <p>I posted the following in the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/Forum12-1.aspx">Killink CSV support forum</a> but decided it might be helpful if posted here to:<br /><br />Starting with Killink CSV v1.2 add cell values are formatted as text.  This is a change from previous versions which used a general format similar to the one found in Excel.  <br /><br />The problem with the general format is that certain values are displayed in a format different then the format used in the actual file.  For example, using the general format the value 01970 is displayed as 1970.  Notice the leading zero is removed.  With a text format the value 01970 is displayed as 01970.  Changing to the text format means you will see the value as it is found in the file, which in my opinion is a good thing.<br /><br />This leads me to the question, do you want the ability to change the format of cells?  <br /><br />I see some advantages to this.  For example, by allowing formatting you could easily convert dates from a Month Day Year format to Year Month Day.  Is this something Killink CSV users would find useful?</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Earlier this week CodeGear released Update 1 for Delphi 2007.  I run Delphi 2007 on my laptop in a VMware virtual machine with XP as the guest OS.  Update 1 installed without a problem.  It took longer than expected, about 45 minutes, but the wait was worth the update.<br /><br />There are many fixes and improvements in Update 1 but the one I noticed right away was the improvements to the online help.  In March I complained that many Delphi routines were not indexed in the online help.  Update 1 fixes this problem which means I no longer need to refer back to BDS 2006 help.<br /><br />Other Delphi news this week…CodeGear as published the <a href="http://dn.codegear.com/article/36620">Delphi Roadmap</a>.  Highlander is still scheduled for release later this year.  Highlander will combine Delphi.NET, Delphi Win32, and C++ Builder into the 2007 RAD Studio, and .NET 2.0 support be provided.<br /><br />Most interesting to me, however, is the release of Tiburon, which is planned for release during the first half of 2008.  This release will provide Unicode support throughout.  This is huge for me since I need to provide Unicode support in my native Windows based application.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I’m making more of an effort to check the log files from my web sites.  During a recent review I noticed a number of hits coming in for the search term “bill gates house”.  I investigated this more today and was surprised by what I found.<br /><br />Go to <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo’s Image Search</a> and search on the phrase “<a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A9iby6AQCldGhgwAhEeLuLkF?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sfp&amp;p=bill+gates+house">bill gates house</a>”.  The 4th image across the top links back to a blog posting I made 3 years go about a <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2004/05/07/usnewscom_technology_bill_gates_house.aspx">virtual tour of Bill Gates’s house</a>.<br /><br />The funny part in all of this is that the image displayed on the Yahoo Image Search is NOT Bill Gates’s House.  It is the <a href="http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/groups/roundhouse/Index.htm">Round House Lodge</a> on top of <a href="http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/">Whistler mountain</a>.  But apparently because my site is listed as number 4 people come to the blog posting in hopes of seeing Bill Gates’s house.  <br /><br />Sorry to disappoint but that picture is not Bill Gates’s house.</p>

    <p>Last month I mentioned <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/04/16/powerpoint_2007_and_outlook_2003_dont_play_nice_together.aspx">Windows automatic update was maxing out the CPU on my computer after I installed PowerPoint 2007</a>.  It seems I’m not the only one dealing with the annoying issue.  Here is a suggested workaround to the <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/blogs/mowgreen/index.php?s=3e9ba5023518c8b34453138b5ab57024&amp;showentry=1071">infamous svchost issue</a>.<br /><br />Also, here is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsupdate/browse_thread/thread/228d22046d54d430/40670938071f33bd?lnk=st&amp;q=wuauclt%2Fsrvchost+at+100%25+today&amp;rnum=1">another newsgroup thread</a> talking about the issue that might be helpful to some.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> The workaround mentioned above does not prevent wuauclt and svchost from using 100% of the CPU but it does make the computer responsive again.  Prior to applying the workaround the computer would be unusable for long periods of time.</p>

        <a href="/2007/05/18/product-website-or-company-website/">Product Website or Company Website</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>When I started White Peak Software 3 and a half years ago I lacked vision for what type of company <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> would become.  Over time visions developed and evolved into a single vision, to be a software vendor.  During this evolution process I created multiple websites for White Peak Software.  There is www.Killink.com for the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv.aspx">csv editor</a> released last month.  There is www.SmtpDiagnostics.com for the first product released by White Peak Software, and there is www.WhitePeakSoftware.com, the official company web site.<br /><br />Each site shares a similar look and feel which provides some synergy between the websites.  But I also felt it led to some confusion in branding.<br /><br />There are a number of reasons I took the approach of having product websites in addition to a company website.  These reasons were based on advice read, heard, and given to me such as:&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Having different product websites is better if products are unrelated.  Unrelated products can lead to confusion by the customer.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Customers can be confused if your website offers both products and services.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Customers might think you will drop support for a product if your product offerings are unrelated.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Having a separate product site makes it easier to sell intellectual property rights to another company.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;A url such as www.myproduct.com might be easier to remember and type then the url for your company web site.<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<br />But after releasing Killink CSV I started second guessing the advice.  To me it seems odd to have the multiple brands.  It seems odd to push a product with its own brand while keeping your company name in the shadows.  It seems odd one would want to start from scratch with a new website.  After all improving a website’s page ranking and relevance within search engines takes a long time.  It seems to me a new product would benefit from being marketed from the vendors existing company website.<br /><br />So I looked at the websites of various software companies which have been successful over the years.  I discovered many of them have a single company website with multiple, unrelated products for sale.  Here are some of the sites I looked at:&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">TechSmith</a>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.liutilities.com/">Uniblue</a>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://ww.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek Software</a>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">SourceGear</a>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br />These software companies sell multiple products including ones that are unrelated to one another.  Some have registered the product name as a domain name, such as <a href="http://www.snagit.com/">snagit.com</a>, that will redirect to the product’s home page within the company’s website.  So if these companies are successful with only a company website then the recommendation that small software companies should have a product website and company website does not always apply, right?<br /><br />This research got me thinking a company website is better than having multiple product websites.  But as I continued researching I found there is no one good approach.  One approach is not better than the other.  To use separate product and company websites or to have only a company website depends on the company.  For instance it is probably better to have a product website separate from the company website when the company’s product is a web-base application.  However for a company like <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> having product websites and a company website doesn’t make a lot of sense.<br /><br />The product website means more work.  Branding gets confusing.  Trying to promote the company brand with the product becomes more challenging, and leveraging the capabilities of the company website can lead to customer confusion.  This is why I decided to consolidate White Peak Software’s product websites into the company website.  This will help me promote the company name at the same time I promote the products.  <br /><br />Google AdWords ads are a perfect example.  Instead of seeing www.Killink.com in the ad you will see www.WhitePeakSoftware.com.  The ad text still talks about <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv.aspx">Killink CSV</a> but the company name now also gets additional exposure.  More exposure is better than less exposure when building a business, right?<br /><br />So after spending a lot of time thinking about the pros and cons of product websites versus company websites, I decided to consolidate the related White Peak Software websites.  In other words, I have eliminated the product websites and now have only the company website.  The product website domain names are still registered and will remain registered.  Surfers who enter killink.com or smtpdiagnostics.com will now be redirected to the product home page within the White Peak Software company website.<br /><br />This is partly a marketing experiment albeit one that will take time to determine the results.  My hope is that consolidating the sites will help increase the company brand and encourage more sells.  Time will tell if this indeed turns out true.  Meanwhile I have the immediate benefit of having only one website to focus on improving instead of three.</p>
