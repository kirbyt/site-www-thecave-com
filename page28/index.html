    <p>Ever wonder how much money WinZip brings in per year, or how much money Jasc, makers of Paint Shop Pro, makes annually?  Corel now owns these two and Corel is planning to go public, which means disclosure to this information.  <br /><br />Thomas Warfield over at A Shareware Life has <a href="http://www.asharewarelife.com/2006/04/winzip_and_jasc.html">posted the numbers</a> and a link to the entire prospectus.  Give it a quick read and see that shareware stars do make big money.  At least these two do.</p>

    <p>CNet news is reporting that <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6057856.html?tag=nl.e589">Apple has announced Boot Camp</a>, a new software package that makes it possible to run Microsoft Windows on the new Intel-based Macs.  How awesome is that!  It’s one step closer to making me want to buy a Mac.  Now what would be really awesome and close the deal for me is to have “Devco” create a Delphi compiler for the Mac OS and make it easy for me to port my VCL applications to Mac.</p>

    <p>I’m having problems resolving a couple of domain names and track the problem back to DNS.  I use Networksolutions’s DNS for the domain names in question and to my surprise <a href="http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=1238">Networksolutions.com is down</a>.  Joy, joy.<br /><br />Update: Networksolutions is back!  Looks like the outage only lasted an hour or so.  I still don’t know what happened through.<br /><br />Final update: Here’s the alert message posted on Network Solutions web site:<br /><br />&lt;div class="quote"&gt;“April 4th, 2006 11:00am EDT - This morning our collocation provider suffered a global outage from 7:56 a.m. to 10:02 a.m. (eastern) that impacted our systems.  The provider’s outage affected access to Network Solutions products and services.  The provider has resolved their systems and access to our services has been resorted.  We appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience. You may experience latency today as we continue to restore our services to full capacity.”&lt;/div&gt;</p>

    <p>I mentioned earlier that <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">Network Solutions</a> was experiencing an outage that effective some of my domain names.  The problem was resolved and all was right in the world again.  Then this evening I got a call from Network Solutions apologizing for the outage.  Wow!  Nice touch.  Kudo to Network Solutions for making this one customer feel special.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2002/03">Four years ago today</a> thecave.com changed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020123100039/http://www.thecave.com/">its look</a> and became my personal blog.  A lot has happened since that time.  I got married, left my corporate job to start <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">my own company</a>, made trips to Paris, Nice, Brussels, and Italy, was the ICCA NYC chapter president for a year, and most recently moved from New York City to Salem, Massachusetts.  It’s been an incredible ride that is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>

    <p>March has been an incredibly busy month for me with the last week being the craziest.  Since Friday I have been at an airport every day except 1.  In other words 5 out of the last 6 days I have spent time at an airport in some city.  But finally the travel is over…for the time being.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>A common question I get since moving to Salem is “Do you miss New York?”  I was thinking about that question this morning as I was standing on the 4-5-6 platform at Grand Central Station.  For those who don’t know, that’s in New York, and the answer is “No”.  I haven’t spent enough time in Salem or enough time away from New York to miss it yet.  It will probably hit me some time this summer but for now I haven’t missed the Big Apple.  Heck, Melanie is still based out of JFK and sees the city more than I do.  I wonder if she misses it yet.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Wow!  Has it really been over a month since my last blog posting?  I guess so.  I didn’t realize so much time had passed.  Guess that’s what happens when you are busy.<br /><br />I’ve been traveling back and forward between Salem and St. Louis this month to teach a series of classes on XML, XSD, XSLT, and Web services.  As expected the first class was a bit rough but the other classes have been a lot of fun.  <br /><br />I never realized how much work goes into preparing for a class.  I have been putting in countless hours preparing course materials, demos, hand-ons exercises, and labs.  And let’s not forget the prep time for speaking.  I’m heading out tomorrow morning to teach the last two days of the class.  It will seem weird not having to think about the classes next week.<br /><br />For those wondering about the status of SMTP Diagnostics 1.6, it’s coming.  The beta release is available from the <a href="">download page</a> and the final release will be available within 2 weeks.<br /><br />I’m also working through the marketing research for another product idea.  I should have more to report in 6 to 7 weeks if I decide to go forward with the new idea.  Meanwhile, Vertigo is still in the works but it’s turning into a much larger project then I originally expected.  A release for this summer is unlikely.<br /><br />That’s a quick update of what’s happening.  Hopefully it won’t be another 4 to 5 weeks before my next posting.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>The blogosphere is buzzing with the latest Borland news, and one common theme is “Who keeps the Borland name and branding?”  It looks like the Borland name will stay with the ALM company while the development tools will be branded under the new company.  <br /><br />My first reaction to this was that the development tools should keep the Borland name.  After all, most people in the development community associate the Borland name with the development tools such as Delphi and JBuilder.  But after thinking about this a bit longer I’m starting to favor a new name.  Brand X Delphi might spark new interest in people who have given up on the Borland name.</p>
