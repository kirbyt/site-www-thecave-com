    </h2>
    
    <p>I re-discovered <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> today and I have to say the latest version totally kicks butt!  I’m finally sportin’ a new laptop with lots of RAM and tons of hard drive space so I thought it was time to look at VMWare again.  The latest workstation release, version 3.2, was very easy to install.  And setting up a new virtual machine has never been easier.  I had Windows 2000 Advance Server up and running in a VM session in under 45 minutes.  No re-partitioning of the hard drive is required.  All VM sessions are stored in a collection of files.  Best of all, I can archive a clean install and restore it later after I have totally screwed up the environment.  My next step is to setup an environment running Java, Apache, etc so I can demo .NET/J2EE interop.  All developers should have the freedom of VMWare on their workstation.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>My Xbox died a couple of weeks ago on <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/home.aspx">my trip</a> to Whistler.  Melanie is working this weekend and I have to say I am missing the game play.  So I finally called the Xbox support number to find out my opinions.  The console I have needs repair work which costs $100, shipping included.  A new Xbox will cost $200.  The difference is I can pick up a new Xbox today but it will be a few weeks before my get back my repaired Xbox.
<br />
<br />A part of me wants to repair the box I have mainly because I am close to finishing Transworld Snowboarding.  It’s the only game I have that does not let me copy my saved games to a memory card.  So if I want to continue the game, I have to repair the box.  But I am jonzen to play.  And starting over is not really a big deal either.
<br />
<br />So what should I do?  Should I repair or replace my Xbox?  What would you do?</p>

        <a href="/2003/02/23/an-xbox-support-scam/">An Xbox Support Scam?</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>Earlier today I called the Xbox support number and talked with a woman about my options for repair of my Xbox.  The cost was $99, which included shipping.  As a matter of fact, she told me they would send me a box to ship my Xbox back to the service center.  Not sure if I wanted to repair or replace, she said I could call back and give my ticket number to complete the repair request.
<br />
<br />So I thought about it a bit and even talked to Melanie to get her opinion.  I decided that spending $100 dollars was better than $200, so I call the support number back.  This time though I was told a different story.  First, it is going to cost $99 plus tax plus shipping bringing my total to $145.  Then to top that, the guy said for another $50 I could buy an extended warranty for my already defective Xbox.  And I have to wait to get my Xbox back should I go with a repair.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.ebgames.com/">EBGames</a> sells factory reconditioned Xbox for $150.  So now the question is do I pay $145 to have my Xbox repaired or $150 to get a reconditioned one, which mine will be after the repair.  If I buy the reconditioned one, I can have it by Tuesday.  If I repair my Xbox, I have to wait at least two weeks.  And let’s not forget I can pay $200 to repair my console and get an extended warranty, or I can pay $200 for a new Xbox with two Sega games.
<br />
<br />I’m starting to think repairing my Xbox is a scam, especially now that I am being told that I have to pay for shipping.  Guess if I had told the first person that I wanted to repair the unit I would not have to pay for shipping, but since I waited 2 hours, now I have to pay.  I don’t get it.  Maybe I will go back to playing my Playstation/2.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>12:27 am Sunday morning waiting for the number 6 downtown.  The uptown 4 speeds by on the express line and I realize I am living a surreal moment in New York.  The greatest city in the world, Saturday night, and my evening includes tea and a poetry reading on Bowery, Xbox and Budweiser,  caso dip and conversations about how hard it is dating in New York.  This is my night.  Uptown number 6 stops and people get off.  Couples holding hands.  Guys with their umbrellas.  It must still be raining outside.
<br />
<br />Finally the downtown number 6 arrives.  I board the train and find a seat.  She’s cute but not my Melanie.  A legless man is making his way down the car on his fist with a coffee can of coins.  Hand outs please.  I wonder how he got down into the subway, and I wonder how he will leave.
<br />
<br />My stop…Lafayette and Bleecker St.  It’s raining.  Crack!  Thunder and lightening in February…how weird.  Great the rain is coming down harder.  Just my luck.  “There goes my hair,” says a bridge and tunnel ho.  Many more looking for shelter from the rain.  What losers!  Just walk in it; you won’t melt.  And if you do, who cares.
<br />
<br />A surreal night in New York City.  The words sounded better in my head 30 minutes ago.  Unfortunately for you, this is what you get.</p>

    <p>As I am sitting on the plane heading to Dallas, I thought it would be fun to share my day with others.  Consider it as a day in the life of a consultant.
<br />
<br />4:15 am: Wake up, shower, and pack a change of clothes and my laptop.
<br />5:15 am: Kiss Melanie goodbye, head out the door and hail a cab.
<br />5:45 am: Pickup the car from Avis.
<br />6:00 am: Leaving the Holland Tunnel and looking for the New Jersey Turnpike.
<br />8:00 am: Arrive in Malvern PA right outside of Philly.
<br />8:15 am: Driving around looking for food.  I’m straving.
<br />8:20 am: Stop at a Circle K for breakfast…mmmm, powder doughnuts.
<br />8:30 am: Arrive at Microsoft’s Philly office.
<br />9:00 am: Meet with customer.  Discuss fun, geeky stuff.
<br />11:50 am: Call Melanie to say hi.
<br />3:30 pm: Leave meeting.  Was told it will take 1.5 hours to get to the airport.
<br />3:40 pm: Call Melanie again.
<br />4:30 pm: Return car to Avis.
<br />4:45 pm: Arrive at the airport with time to spare.
<br />5:50 pm: Call Melanie one last time.  She is flying out to Paris tonight.
<br />6:00 pm: Take off to Dallas.
<br />10:00 pm: Arrive in Dallas and take taxi to the hotel.
<br />10:25 pm: Call the hotel.  The cabbie is lost.
<br />10:40 pm: Check into the hotel.
<br />10:50 pm: Order pizza and make a few phone calls.
<br />11:00 pm: Check e-mail.
<br />12:00 am: Finally, the pizza is here.
<br />12:20 am: Tummy is full.  Time for bed.
<br />12:30 am: Fall asleep.
<br />
<br />That was my day.  And it all starts all over again at 6:00 am.</p>

    <p>Melanie and I decided to enjoy the snow from today’s blizzard with a walk through Central Park.  The park was full of people enjoying the weather; from snowboarders riding the short hills to cross country skiers out for a bit of exercise to kids riding sleds, we saw it all.  Hopefully I will get some pictures posted very soon.</p>

    <p>After two weeks of no new snow in Whistler, I return home just in time for a big dump in New York City.  Looks like over a foot of snow so far and it’s still coming down.  I love it but I wish this had happened in Whistler.  And I wish I had a car because I would definitely be heading up to Catkills to snowboard.</p>
