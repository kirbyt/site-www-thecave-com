        <title>How I post to my Jekyll site using my iPhone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My blog site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecave.com&quot;&gt;thecave.com&lt;/a&gt;, is a static HTML site generated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. I love that the site is static HTML as it means I can host the site virtually anywhere. But, unlike dynamic blog sites, like those powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, I haven‚Äôt been able to publish new posts from my iPhone. And with the upcoming release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://micro.blog&quot;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;, creating new micro-posts for thecave.com from my iPhone is something I want to do, but how? How can I update my Jekyll site, with its source code hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and custom plug-ins that can‚Äôt run on Github Pages, using my iPhone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out to answer this question, and low and behold; I found the answer. Well, the answer that works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theres-an-app-for-that&quot;&gt;There‚Äôs an App for That&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I need an app on my iPhone that lets me push changes to my site‚Äôs Github repository. In other words, I need a git client on iOS. I decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://workingcopyapp.com&quot;&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs a great app and easy to use. Best of all you can try it out for free. The app developer offers a 1-week free trial that lets you push changes to a git repo. After the trial period expires, you must pay to unlock the push feature, but the $14.99 price tag is well worth it in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I need a way to write my posts. Working Copy has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; editor built in, which is great for editing existing posts. But there are better editors in the App Store. First, I tried 1Writer since I already have it, and I use it for writing notes and such. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt play well with Working Copy, so I continued my search for the ideal editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bywordapp.com&quot;&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt;, the next app I looked at, looks beautiful, and reviewers have commented how they are using it with Working Copy. But I ended up not trying Byword because I discovered Editorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://omz-software.com/editorial/&quot;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt; has a built-in workflow engine, and while this app might not look as pretty as Byword, it is much more powerful, thanks to a built-in workflow engine, and suited to my needs. I bought Editorial right away and started playing with different workflows that already work with Working Copy. After some trial and error, I created two workflows. One lets me publish a post to thecave.com, and the other lets me publish a micro-post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two workflows is subtle. The workflow I use to publish a post lets me pick a category and add tags. The micro-post workflow lets me choose a category and add other tags. For my micro-post to be picked up by micro.blog, I must use the tag ‚Äúmicropost,‚Äù and this workflow enforces this rule. Also, my micro-post workflow sets an empty title in the front matter YAML, which brings me to the question‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-i-need-these-workflows&quot;&gt;Why Do I Need These Workflows?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workflows save me time and simplify the publish steps. For instance, Jekyll uses YAML as &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot;&gt;front matter&lt;/a&gt; for each post. There‚Äôs no way I want to write this front matter by hand on my iPhone each time. I can use TextExpander, but seeing the front matter can be distracting on my iPhone. So I let Editorial‚Äôs workflow work its magic to generate the YAML front matter before handing off the document to Working Copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workflow also names the file with the appropriate YYYY-MM-DD prefix that Jekyll expects, and it does one other thing for me as well. It sends the appropriate commands to Working Copy so it can add, commit, and push the new document to my git repository. And after Working Copy finishes its job, it returns me back to Editorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the Editorial workflow lets me publish a new post with a single tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XXX INSERT VIDEO HERE XXX&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sharing-my-workflows&quot;&gt;Sharing My Workflows&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared my two workflows on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editorial-workflows.com&quot;&gt;Editorial Workflows&lt;/a&gt;, which is a directory of workflows. You can use them as is or tweak them to your liking. You must, however, set the key and repo name variables at the start of the workflow as these will be unique to your install of Working Copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5790030849114112/WIlXHDBWQBQ&quot;&gt;KT: Send Jekyll Post using Working Copy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5335890234703872/dIfk8O40fDM&quot;&gt;KT: Send micropost using Working Copy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-custom-jekyll-plug-ins&quot;&gt;Using Custom Jekyll Plug-ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to generate your blog site, and you host your site on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;, then all you need is &lt;a href=&quot;http://omz-software.com/editorial/&quot;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://workingcopyapp.com&quot;&gt;Working Copy&lt;/a&gt; to publish new content from your iPhone. That is, assuming you are not using custom plug-ins. If you are not using custom plug-ins, then Github Pages will generate the Jekyll site for you when you push changes to the master branch. I, however, use a custom plug-ins for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecave.com&quot;&gt;thecave.com&lt;/a&gt;, which means Github Pages will not generate my site for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I use custom plug-ins, I must generate my site locally using my laptop. This means I cannot publish new content from my iPhone. Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-continuous-integration-to-build-a-jekyll-site&quot;&gt;Using Continuous Integration to Build a Jekyll Site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that I can use a build server or continuous integration (CI) environment to build my site when changes are pushed to the master branch. After all, I do this with the iOS apps I make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My CI of choice is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitrise.io&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt;. It provides continuous integration and delivery services for mobile apps, but it can also be used to generate a Jekyll site. Best of all, their ‚Äúfree forever‚Äù &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitrise.io/pricing&quot;&gt;Hobby plan&lt;/a&gt; can be used to generate a Jekyll site and push it out to Github Pages. Here‚Äôs my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com/blob/master/bitrise.yml&quot;&gt;bitrise.yml&lt;/a&gt; that defines the Bitrise workflow steps that build and publish my Jekyll site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-thats-how-i-do-it&quot;&gt;And That‚Äôs How I Do It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs how I publish new content to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecave.com&quot;&gt;thecave.com&lt;/a&gt; using my iPhone. I admit it‚Äôs a bit geeky, but know that it is setup, I can publish new posts from iPhone with a tap of my finger.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Convert Time with a TextExpander Snippet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I find I am using &lt;a href=&quot;https://textexpander.com&quot;&gt;TextExpander&lt;/a&gt; more and more these days. It‚Äôs an awesome productivity tool that saves me time by inserting snippets of text into whatever I‚Äôm writing, be it code or words. What I didn‚Äôt know about TextExpander, that is, until today, is that it can run shell scripts to generate the text snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often meet with people on the West Coast. When I schedule a meeting time, I will say something like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs meet at 01:30 PM EDT / 10:30 AM PDT‚Äù in the email. Not only is this a lot of text to type, but it also requires I calculate the Pacific time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How cool would it be if TextExpander could generate the time snippet for me? Guess what. It can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a shell script snippet that takes a local time, which I input, and calculates the Eastern and Pacific times. I use &lt;em&gt;timept;;&lt;/em&gt; for the snippet abbreviation. Now when I want to mention a particular time in an email, I type &lt;em&gt;timept;;&lt;/em&gt; and enter the time. TextExpander does the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the shell script code for anyone who might want it. Make sure you select &lt;strong&gt;Shell Script&lt;/strong&gt; as the &lt;em&gt;Content&lt;/em&gt; type when creating the snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#! /bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Enter a time using 24H. 1:30pm is 13:30 .&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ENTERTIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;%filltext:name=Time (in 24H)%&quot;&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# See https://gist.github.com/palaniraja/f8e21e8c66eac7e1b313 for a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# list of time zone names.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;TZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;America/New_York&quot;&lt;/span&gt; date -jf &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;%H:%M %z&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ENTERTIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;date &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;+%z&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;+%I:%M %p %Z&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;TZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;&lt;/span&gt; date -jf &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;%H:%M %z&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ENTERTIME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;date &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;+%z&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;+%I:%M %p %Z&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; -n &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$T1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; / &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$T2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

        <title>Mastodon and thecave.social</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I first heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; last week while lurking on Twitter. For those who don‚Äôt know, Mastodon is a free, open source, decentralized social network with instances run mostly by individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I read more about Mastodon, I became more intrigued. It didn‚Äôt take long before I registered the domain name &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecave.social/&quot;&gt;thecave.social&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of hosting a Mastodon instance, even if just for myself, piqued the geek in me. The realist in me said I don‚Äôt have the extra time to take on such an endeavor. Still, I wanted to learn more about Mastodon, and what better way than hosting an instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I looked at hosting my Mastodon instance on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openshift.com&quot;&gt;OpenShift Online&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôm a long time fan of OpenShift, but it‚Äôs been a while since I played on it. Turns out, a new OpenShift Online supporting Docker containers is in the works. Right now, the new OpenShift Online is in Developer Preview, and accounts are active for only 30 days. The time limit doesn‚Äôt work for me because I can see myself hosting my Mastodon instance for more than a month. So OpenShift is not an option for me at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at hosting the instance somewhere else, like Digital Ocean, but I decided I don‚Äôt have the time to do all the extra work. Thankfully, there is an experimental Heroku install option for Mastodon, and given that I already have some basic experience with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heroku.com&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, I decided it is the way to go for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After deciding where to host my instance, I did a ‚Äútest‚Äù install. I created a single dyno and played around with Mastodon. Liking what I saw, I scrapped the dyno and created another one, this time for thecave.social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me about four hours total to get my Mastodon instance setup and configured the way I want it. A more experienced admin could have probably done the work in half the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mailgun.com&quot;&gt;Mailgun&lt;/a&gt; for emails and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; for file storage. And now that Heroku has an automatic certificate manager that uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org&quot;&gt;Let‚Äôs Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, acquiring and installing an SSL/TLS certificate for the site was a snap. I‚Äôm continually amazed at how easy it is to host a server these days thanks to services like Mailgun, S3, and Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thecave.social/&quot;&gt;thecave.social&lt;/a&gt; has been live for a few days now, and everything is running smoothly. Of course, I am the only user on this instance, and I do not support the streaming API yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve even made a few toots on Mastodon, which is impressive for me given that I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time on social networks these days. (I‚Äôve checked Facebook once in the last 28 days, and I lurk on Twitter only once or twice a month.) Still, I can see myself getting into Mastodon because it represents what I like about social networks, and it doesn‚Äôt have the crap that has turned me off of social networks in general, ads and political rants being the top offenders for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, registration on thecave.social is closed, though I‚Äôm considering opening it up to family and friends soon. Let me know if you are interested in having an account so I can tell you when registration is open. I can‚Äôt guarantee how long I will keep the server up and running, but I don‚Äôt see myself shutting it down anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I‚Äôm not looking to grow a big community with hundreds or even thousands of users. Instead, I want a place that is my own just like I have with my personal email address. Some family and friends have thecave.com email address, and I see the same thing happening with thecave.social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you on other Mastodon instances, feel free to follow me at &lt;a href=&quot;https://thecave.social/@kirby&quot;&gt;@kirby@thecave.social&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
