    </h2>
    
    <p>The January 2006 issue of the online magazine Bitwise Magazine has a good <a href="http://www.bitwisemag.com/copy/reviews/software/programming/borland/bds2006.html">review of Borland Developer Studio</a>.  The reviewer makes some very good points, although I do not complete agree with one point, C# programmers will prefer Visual Studio.  As someone who also writes code in C# I prefer BDS over Visual Studio.  I’m more productive using a single IDE then using two separate IDE.  Using two separate IDE means I have to remember two sets of the hotkeys, how-to’s, and so on.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>A good friend of mine is interested in doing some Delphi programming for personal projects.  Unfortunately he has no way of using the latest release of Delphi without spending money on a new user license.  On the contrary, the hobbyist programmer who wishes to learn C# can download and use Microsoft’s Visual C# Express free of charge.  <br /><br />I’m always talking up the benefits of Delphi to my friends and I’m constantly telling other developers to give it a try.  But the sad reality is that those interested in looking at Delphi for the first time or the hobbyist slash student who wants to use Delphi for personal projects and to learn cannot without spending lots of dollars for a new user license.<br /><br />Get a clue Borland!  Make a Personal Edition free for those programmers who wish to learn more about Delphi or use it for personal projects.  And make it downloadable from your web site.  You will have more Delphi customers in the long run if you do.<br /><br />As for my friend, Borland has just lost a potential customer by not providing a freeware version Delphi.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update</span>: Seems I’m not the only one talking about the lack of a Personal Edition or trial version of Delphi.  <a href="http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/d2006trial.html">What about Delphi 2006 Trial and Personal?</a></p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>After installing FinalBuilder for the first time, I looked through the list of actions to see what 3rd party tools were supported.  I was pleasantly surprised to see an action for every tool I use in software development except one, DUnit.  I thought this was odd but I soon realized that DUnit is supported, just not as a custom action.<br /><br />Follow these steps to use DUnit in FinalBuilder:<br /><br />1) Add a Compile Delphi Win32 Project action to your FinalBuilder project.<br />2) Point the Compile Delphi action to your DUnit project and configure it as needed to compile the project.<br />3) Add an Execute Program action to the FinalBuilder project.  This action is found under the Windows OS action group.<br />4) Point the action to the compiled bits from the Compile Delphi action.  In other words, point it to your DUnit program.<br />5) Mark the Log Output option, which should be marked by default.<br /><br />That’s it.  FinalBuilder will run your DUnit unit tests as part of the build process and the output from the tests will be captured by FinalBuilder.  And of course you can configure the FinalBuilder project to act accordingly based on the pass/fail result of your unit tests.<br /><br />Some people might think FinalBuilder should have a custom action for DUnit.  However, the action would only be a direct copy of the Execute Program action.  Or maybe it would combine the Compile Delphi and Execute Program actions into a single action.  But as you can see a custom action is not needed.  DUnit unit tests are support through the Execute Program action and a custom action specific to DUnit would just be a waste of time for the folks at Vsoft Technologies.  Their time is better spent adding support for more tools and adding more features to an already great product,<br />FinalBuilder.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I spent the day migrating various Visual Studio projects to Borland Developer Studio 2006.  For the most part the projects easily moved over but I did have some problems with one project group.  <br /><br />This project group contains multiple C# library projects and an ASP.NET C# web application.  The BDS converter for the project group did not set the parent reference for some of the .aspx and .ascx files.  However, I was able to quickly fix this using a text editor.<br /><br />One Visual Studio feature I do miss since moving to Borland Developer Studio is Copy Web Project.  I really like this feature to xcopy an ASP.NET web application to a new directory that contains only the files needed for runtime.  The Professional Edition of BDS does not have this feature.  However, I was able to quickly clone this feature using FinalBuilder.<br /><br />Right now I’m very happy with the move to Borland Developer Studio.  Using one IDE for all my development work (Delphi, C# and ASP.NET 1.1) is making me a more productive software developer.</p>

        <a href="/2006/01/11/finalbuilder-is-a-must-have-for-constructing-build-processes/">FinalBuilder is a Must Have for Constructing Build Processes</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>For years I have relied on custom built build processes for software I develop.  For instance, on a recent large-scale .NET solution I used a combination of NTScheduler, VMware Workstation, CVS, NAnt, and the .NET SDK (along with other tools) to build an automated build environment.  However, doing something similar for every one of my software projects is time consuming, and I have to rely on different tools for different projects.  For example NAnt is useless for a Delphi Win32 project.  So I finally decided to give FinalBuilder a try.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.finalbuilder.com/">FinalBuilder is the ultimate tool for constructing a build process</a>.  Within minutes I was able to automate a build process for a box inventory program I am working on.  Of course projects with a more complex build process will take more than a few minutes to setup, but you should be able to automate a build process in minutes and not hours or days for most projects.  <br /><br />I’m amazed at the flexibility provided by FinalBuilder.  It supports a wide array of compilers and tools.  And it has an easy-to-use GUI for construction of the build process for every time of project I’m working on.<br /><br />I decided to see how long it would take to setup a build process for <a href="http://www.smtpdiagnostics.com/">SMTP Diagnostics</a>.  Although SMTP Diagnostics is a simple product, its build process involves a number of steps.  It is the perfect product to evaluate FinalBuilder with.  <br /><br />Here are the steps in the build process that I wanted to automate through FinalBuilder:<br /><br />- Create a build directory sandbox<br />- Retrieve the latest source code from <a href="http://www.cvsnt.org">CVS</a><br />- Compile the GUI program (using <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 compiler)<br />- Compile <a href="http://www.eurekalog.com/">EurekaLog</a> into the GUI program<br />- Compile to console program (using <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 compiler)<br />- Compile the licensing framework into the GUI and console programs (using <a href="http://www.siliconrealms.com/software.shtml">Armadillo</a>)<br />- Generate the help file system (using <a href="http://www.ec-software.com/hmpage.htm">Help&amp;Manual;</a>)<br />- Generate the installer (using <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>)<br />- Generate a zip file containing the generated installer<br />- Update and commit build number changes to CVS<br />- Tag release in CVS<br /><br />In less than 30 minutes I was able to setup the SMTP Diagnostics build process in FinalBuilder.  I can now make a complete build of SMTP Diagnostics in under a minute with a click of a button.  <br /><br />My next step in exploring FinalBuilder will be to generate the online help as HTML files and upon successful build of the product push the HTML files and the installer out to SMTP Diagnostics web site.  Given the time I spent playing with FinalBuilder, I’m confident I will be able to automate these steps as well.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>For Christmas Melanie gave me a copy of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/d/deadoralive4/">Dead Or Alive 4</a> for the Xbox 360.  The game wasn’t released until the end of the December so I had to wait.  But it finally came in this week and last night I got a chance to play it.<br /><br />My review can be summed up in 4 simple words: My thumb is sore!<br /><br />I must have played 8 hours or so last night.  And yes my thumb is sore.  The game is awesome.  Story Mode can be frustrating at times but I was able to finish it in one night.  The frustration is not a bad thing although it seems like it when you are playing.  The AI in this game is incredible, which made Story Mode challenging and frustrating at the same time.<br /><br />Like other Xbox 360 games DOA4 supports leaderboards.  You can, for example, compare your best Survival Mode score against other players world wide.  My current ranking is around 10,500 out of 25,000 players.  I definitely need to work on improving that ranking.  <br /><br />As I have mentioned before, Xbox Live really makes Xbox 360 a great console.  Having the ability to compare my ranking and achievement to other players causes me to play more, and in turn leaves me wanting to buy more games.  Xbox Live is really the shining star of the Xbox 360 for the moment.  But this review is about DOA4, not Xbox Live.<br /><br />DOA4 comes with online play as well.  I played “Versus” challenges for a bit last night online.  Unfortunately I didn’t do as well as I had hoped.  There are some top notch players out there.  Online play was fun but the game play was a bit choppy.  I couldn’t tell if the performance problem was caused by my DSL line or if the problem was coming from the DOA4/Live servers.  I need to check the forums to see if other DOA4 players are experiencing the same choppiness.  I have not noticed any performance problems with other Xbox Live enabled games so I have to believe it is not my DSL line.<br /><br />Another feature I like about DOA4 is Sparring Mode.  There is a feature within this mode called Exercise, which is a great way to learn all the button combinations for a given character.  I will definitely spend more time in this mode to learn more of the advance moves and combinations.<br /><br />Overall, DOA4 is great.  The graphics are amazing.  The game play is fun.  The leaderboards are addicting.  And online play is a blast.  <br /><br />Thanks Melanie for getting me this great game.</p>
