    </h2>
    
    <p>Salem Mass is often known as The Witch City, but it’s also trying hard to become a bike city. One example of this comes from today’s announcement about a <a href="http://www.salemnews.com/local/x850300025/Salem-to-join-major-cities-in-offering-bike-sharing-program">free bike sharing program</a> here in Salem. The city has also made improvements to off-road bike paths and recently completed the striping of on-street bike lanes. The problem, however, I have with biking in Salem is with the North Shore drivers.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I received an email today telling me a company is attempting to use my company name to register a .asia domain name. My first call to action was to check with my preferred domain name registrar to see if the .asia name was actually available, which it is.  Next I searched to see if there are any rules or restrictions regarding a U.S. based companying owning a .asia domain name. Then finally I decided to search the name of the company attempting to register the .asia domain name.  Turns out it is a scam.<br /><br />This scam almost got me.  It wasn’t until I searched the literal <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22LYP+International+co.%2C+Inc%22&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=">LYP International co., Inc</a> that I discovered this insightful blog posting by Joe Wein about <a href="http://www.joewein.net/blog/2008/12/08/domain-registration-scam-in-china">domain registration scams</a> coming from China.<br /><br />Don’t you just love the power of the Internet?</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>We have the <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/evolve">Griffin Evolve</a> sound system for the iPod, which I use from time to time to listen to music from my iPod touch.  Unfortunately the sound system was within reach of <a href="http://www.rowanturner.net/">Rowan</a> who decided yesterday to pull back and forth on the docked iPod touch.  This unfortunately bent the connector pins in the iPod touch connector port.  And now whenever the iPod touch is docked the music starts and stops, plays out only 1 speaker, and or sometimes it makes an awful noise. <br /><br />Okay, so I can’t use the iPod touch with the Griffin system by docking it.  That’s fine.  I’ll just connect it using the headphone jack.  Problem solved, or so I thought.<br /><br />Today I discovered the iPod touch shorting out when connected to my laptop.  It didn’t occur to me yesterday I would have this problem but an electrical short is an electrical short. And no matter what I try the device keeps disconnecting and reconnecting every minute or so when plugged into the laptop.<br /><br />I’m debating whether I should try getting the device fixed or just buy another one.  If I get another one I can let the kid have the broken one.  It could be fun to see how long it takes before he completely destroys it. <br /><br />Regardless of what I decide to do, I did learn my lesson and now the sound system is out of the kid’s reach.</p>

        <a href="/2009/02/24/our-healthcare-system-sucks/">Our Healthcare System Sucks</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>My wife and I have health insurance provided through her employer.  The coverage is good, typical of what most large corporations offer.  And yet even though we have health insurance we still had to pay $2634.20 in out of pocket medical expenses, and this number doesn’t even include the cost for medicines such as the $50 cream we had to buy for our little one.  Oh, and did I mention that we opted to NOT pay Cobra $3000 for the 3 months of medical coverage NOT provided by the insurance company due to the fact that my wife was taking some unpaid time off to be with our new child?  <br /><br />During that 3 month period our out of pocket medical expenses were $322.03.  The great state of Massachusetts requires all residents have health insurance, but honestly we could not afford it.  Do the math, folks.  To stay “legal” we were being asked to pay just over $3000 to cover $322.03 worth of medical expenses.  That makes no freakin’ sense.<br /><br />For those wondering, Cobra is pro-rated so we had up to 3 months to apply.  The unpaid time off was only 3 months, so we decided to wait until the final day to decided whether to pay for Cobra coverage or not.  If our total medical expenses during the 3 month period were more then $3000 we would apply, otherwise we would pay the expenses ourselves.  Since our total medical expenses were during that time were far less we opted to not enroll into Cobra.  But wait.  There’s more.<br /><br />As I said Massachusetts requires every resident to have health insurance.  According to the official document from our insurance company that must be included with our state income tax return, we did not have health insurance for 3 months during 2008.  This means we violated state law for 3 months.  I’m just waiting to see what penalties we will have to pay to the state because I refused to pay $3000 to cover $322.03 worth of medical expenses.<br /><br />Back to the math.  So $322.03 of the $2634.20 was because of the Cobra slash unpaid time off issue.  I’m okay with paying $322.02 to save $2677.97.  This still leaves $2312.17 worth of medical expenses not covered by our health insurance provider during the time when we did have full coverage.  What were these expenses, you ask?  More than half of the expenses were related to my wife’s pregnancy and the delivery of our first child.  We had to pay an additional $1577.55 out of our own pocket just to have a baby. <br /><br />This leaves $734.62, which is the amount I paid to get 4 stitches near my eye from an accident.  Had the accident happened a couple of hours earlier the amount would paid have been around $291.28 but the medical clinic near our house was closed at the time of the accident leaving me no choice but to go to the emergency room.  And no, I couldn’t wait until the next day.  I had a deep cut less than a quarter of an inch away from my eye with lots of blood coming out.  Waiting was not an option.<br /><br />Let’s recap the out of pocket expenses:<br /><br />* $1577.55 to have a baby<br />* $734.62 to stitch a cut near my eye<br />* $322.03 pediatric visit during the unpaid time off<br /><br />Grand total: $2634.20<br /><br />There is a serious problem in the United States regarding healthcare.  And while the government powers that be are focused on stimulus packages, corporate bail outs, and trying to improve the economy, it seems to me healthcare reform is something the U.S. government ignored for years.  Don’t believe me?  Watch Michael Moore’s documentary <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/index.html">Sicko</a> and see for yourself.<br /><br />I know my situation is minor compare to the many, many others who have major medical issues.  However the point I’m trying to make here is that even with health insurance a typical American family may still have to pay out of pocket medical expenses that can be a struggle to afford.  Not only that, but in my own situation if the U.S. had a better healthcare system like the ones found in other countries such as Canada and France I would have been able to put the $2634.20 into the pockets of local retailers or maybe a contractor to do some work on the house thus doing my part to help stimulate the economy.<br /><br />As a side note and since I did mention Canada, I have to say from personal experience that the Canadian healthcare system is awesome, really awesome.  A few years back I fractured my leg on a snowboarding trip in Canada.  The total cost to see the doctor, get x-rays, etc, $86 Canadian which at that time came out to about $60 U.S. dollars.  Meanwhile, here in the U.S., 4 stitches and an ER visit costed me $734.62.  Something is seriously wrong with our healthcare system!<br /><br />Update: My wife found 2 more invoices totaling $190 bringing our out of pocket medical expenses for 2008 to a total of $2824.20.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I really need to find time to make more blog posting. I definitely have lots to say, opinions to share, tips and tricks learned from some of the programming work I have done over the last few months. But it seems I never have time to write.<br /><br />I’m currently working on new releases for Labor Mate, my <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/labormate">labor contraction stopwatch for the iPhone and iPod touch</a>, and Killink CSV Editor, a <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv">csv editor</a> for the Windows desktop. I’m also working on 3 different custom software development projects for customers and I have another one that will be starting soon. And the new White Peak Software website will be ready very, very soon with new customer support features coming soon. Needless to say, I’m swamped.<br /><br />And of course <a href="http://www.rowanturner.net/">Rowan</a> is only 10 months old and I have to spend as much time as I can with him. Lucky for me I work from home so I get to spend plenty of time with the little guy daily, which is great. But he does interrupt my work from time to time.<br /><br />With luck and some focused time getting some of the projects completed, I’ll be back blogging before you know it. Meanwhile you can <a href="http://twitter.com/kirbyt">follow me</a> over at Twitter.</p>

        <a href="/2008/12/08/framework-or-cms/">Framework or CMS</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>I am once again pondering the question of whether to use a framework or CMS for the upcoming refresh the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> web site.  I have gone back and forth on this multiple times over the years and I can never really decide which is better.  And I ask this question often not just for my company web site but for customer web sites that I build.<br /><br />A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework">framework</a> gives me great control and flexibility.  I can design and architect the site to my liking.  I can use the data store of my choice be it XML, a database such as MSSQL or <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>, and I can implement site specific features that meet 100% of the requirements.  But the site eventually reaches a point where the only thing needed is to publish new content.  Create a new landing page for marketing, change copy on an existing page, add a new product page, and so on.  This is when I start thinking “Man, I wish I had a really simple CMS in place.”<br /><br />A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a> manages the site content for me.  A CMS really does make publishing new content a snap.  And you get a lot of additional features, or add-ons, with a CMS such as blog engine, forums or discussion groups, user management, calendar, photo gallery…the list goes on.  However, most if not all CMSs are built on top of some core framework (<a href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a> uses <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>, <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> uses .NET, <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a> uses <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgnitor</a> - I think).  This allows developers to expand and enhance the CMS by writing their own add-ons and extensions.  But to do this the developer needs to know the underlying framework, and if you already know the framework isn’t it sometimes easier and or faster to work directly with the framework bypassing the CMS all together?  Also, it’s been my experience that many of the CMSs out there tend to meet only 80 to 90% of the requirements.  So you get the ease of publishing new content but other areas of the site can be lacking unless, of course, additional code is written to make up for the missing functionality.  It’s a vicious circle.<br /><br />So do you learn and master a framework and have ultimate flexibility or learn and master a CMS and have ease of use for managing content?  And what about rolling your own “simple” CMS.  It can be great experience in the beginning but it will eventually have limitations or even worse become yet another full feature CMS like those already available today.  And if you end up writing your own full featured CMS you have to ask yourself “Would my time have been better spent learning and mastering an existing CMS, its framework and contributing to its community?”<br /><br />Unfortunately I don’t have any solid answers here.  I guess the only real answer to the question should I use a framework or CMS is “It depends.”  It depends on a number of different factors unique to your situation, your needs, your time line, and so on.<br /><br />So what have I decided for the White Peak Software web site refresh?  Honestly I’m still a bit undecided.  The site is currently implemented with ASP.NET and a home grown simple CMS mechanism.  It has worked well for a number of years but I need more functionality on the site.  Building on the current implementation would take too much time so I need a different approach.  My original thought was to use PHP and Zend but then I discovered CodeIgnitor.  CodeIgnitor led me to ExpressEngine and I thought “Ah, the solution for me.  PHP+CodeIgnitor+ExpressEngine”.  But then I started looking at python for general programming tasks and thought “What would it take to use Python programming for web apps?”  Not much I found out so I have decided to use <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.<br /><br />The decision to use Python has lead me to look at a number of different frameworks and CMS solutions.  And while I’m not 100% sure what stack I will select, I’m leaning towards Python + web2py.  <a href="http://www.web2py.com/">web2py</a> is an enterprise ready framework for web based application.  Web development using web2py is very easy and fast, and I really like the development experience on my Mac.<br /><br />I guess it’s safe to assume at this point that I will once again pick a framework over an existing CMS.  What can I say?  I’m a programmer and while the appeal for a CMS is there I still enjoy the flexibility and control I have by doing my own implementation using a framework.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> Here is a <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2008/12/08/framework_or_cms_revisited.aspx">follow up posting</a> that explains my own requirements and why I feel using a framework is better in my situation.</p>

In the post I talk about the two approaches in general terms and I end the post saying I will very liking use a framework for the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> web site refresh.  Everyone who sent me feedback suggested I use a CMS for White Peak but unfortunately I didn’t really say what my requirements are.  Knowing the requirements might change the opinions of some.</p>
