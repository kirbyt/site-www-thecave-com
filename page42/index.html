    </h2>
    
    <p>In this recent article on eWeek, Tod Nielsen said <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1993731,00.asp?kc=EWEAUEMNL072506EOAD">Borland is close to naming the buyer for DevCo</a>.  He also said the process should be complete by the end of September.  Exciting time indeed for software developers.  <br /><br />Many people thing Delphi is dead, but they are dead wrong.  I’ve been hearing the same time for 10 years now from people who have never even tried Delphi.  “Delphi is dead.”  “There is no future for Delphi.” And so on.  Not only is this wrong, but the future of Delphi is brighter than ever.<br /><br />I jumped onto the .NET C# bandwagon in the early days.  My first C# work started right after the Summer 2000 PDC, and I worked with C# exclusively from 2001 through most of 2004.  <br /><br />Soon after starting <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com">White Peak Software</a> I realized I needed a “secret weapon” not only for custom software development work but for the products White Peak Software plans to publish.  That secret weapon is <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a>.  I have been able to do so much more for our customers, in less time and at a lower cost beacuse Delphi.<br /><br />Corporations and uppper management will never get it.  Microsoft development tools are a safe choice, and in many cases .NET within the enterprise makes the most sense.  But for those developers who need a tool that allows them to do many things, Delphi or rather Borland Developer Studio is perfect.  The ability to write native Win32 application and .NET applications from the same IDE is priceless.</p>

    <p>A good read about one person’s opinion on why <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/nickhodges/archive/2006/07/25/26224.aspx">Delphi is less risky</a> compared to Microsoft development tools.  I concur with this opinion.  Heck just the other day I incorporated some Delphi code that I wrote some 10 years ago into a customer application.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>The last few weeks have been very busy for me so I haven’t had time to post as many blog entries as I would like.  SO here’s a quick list of random thoughts I have had recently.<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.winternals.com/Company/PressRelease92.aspx">Microsoft acquires SysInternals and WinInternals</a>.  Big news in my opinion.  I’m curious to see what Microsoft will do with the excellent SysInternal tools like Process Explorer.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Speaking of SysInternals, Mark Russinovich has an interested <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/04/coming-net-world-im-scared.html">take on .NET managed application</a>.  I agree with him that client only applications shouldn’t be managed applications.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">Foxit Reader</a> is awesome.  It is a PDF reader but unlike Adobe’s PDF reader Foxit loads fast and doesn’t require an install.  The single Foxit exe has made its way into my bin directory of useful tools.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Allen Bauer points out that <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/abauer/archive/2006/07/19/26094.aspx">Foxit has an SDK</a> that allows you to embed a PDF reader into your application.  And best of all it supports <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi/">Delphi</a>.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.babyotis.com/index.php?/archives/201-Silence.html">Four grand to remove a tree</a>?  Makes me question whether home ownership is worth the trouble and unexpected expenses.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/07/21/borland_tools_buyer/">DevCo is one step closer</a>.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;I recently started some new work in Visual Studio 2003 and I immediately started missing features from <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Borland Developer Studio 2006</a>.  Most noticeable was the lack of built-in support for unit test projects and creating unit test cases.  BDS simplifies the setup of unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I lived in the West Village, Manhattan for just over 6 years.  Earlier this year my wife and I moved to Salem, Massachusetts.  We have a number of reasons for moving such as a change in life style, wanting to be closer to the mountains of New England, etc.  Cost is definitely one of the reasons.  We were spending more and more time outside of NYC making it hard to justify paying high rent for an apartment we didn’t see much, especially in the winter time.  <br /><br />I was surprise to learn that Essex County, Massachusetts, which is where Salem is located, is ranked at the top of the recent <a href="http://realestate.msn.com/Rentals/Articleforbes.aspx?cp-documentid=648559&amp;GT1=8384">Forbes most overprice places in the United States</a>.  (New York is ranked number 6.)  Granted we don’t live in one of the <a href="http://rmne-remaxadvantagerealestate-salem-ma.com/Properties/PropDispForm.php?idx_prop=101582664&amp;QueryID=44b53c2373630&amp;3">awesomely big water front homes</a> mentioned in the article.  I wish we did.  But homes at a million and more is beyond what we can afford.  I will say, though, that $1.4 million for a 4,000 square foot water front home does seem like a better deal to me than a $1.4 million, 2 bedroom, 900 square foot condo in downtown Manhattan.</p>

        <a href="/2006/06/27/using-dokuwiki-at-white-peak-software/">Using DokuWiki at White Peak Software</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>One of the items on my never ending to-do list is to install a wiki for internal use at <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>.  It’s been on my list for over a year to do but it seems I never have the time.  Last week I saw the internal wiki of another small software company and thought to myself, “I need to do the same.”  So today I decided to take a break from my normal work to install a wiki.<br /><br />There are a lot of different wiki software options available so I started by reviewing the popular ones at <a href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/">WikiMatrix</a>.  This site even has a <a href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/wizard.php">Wiki Choice Wizard</a> that helps find a wiki software package based on requirement needs.<br /><br />The selection criteria was simple.  I need something that will run on a Windows server under IIS and does not require a database.  The content should be stored in the file system in case a need arises that requires access to the data outside of the wiki software.  The software I settled on is <a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki">DokuWiki</a>.<br /><br />DokuWiki is written in PHP so my first step was to download the latest version of <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.  A Windows installer is provided that will not only install PHP but configure IIS to use PHP.  The installer ran without a problem, which made me very happy.<br /><br />Next I downloaded the DokuWiki software and un-archived the tar file.  I setup a wiki folder and copied the DokuWiki to the new folder.  I created a new web site using the IIS management console and pointed the web site to the wiki folder.  Within a few minutes, from installing PHP to copying the DokuWiki files to setting up the web site, the wiki site was up and running.<br /><br />The more time consuming part has been adding content to the wiki site.  I started by creating a new start page with links to various White Peak Software resources.  I also setup a “Clients” wiki page.  From there I started adding content about each client and client project.  Even after 3 hours I haven’t made it very far.  There’s too much information to add.  I imagine I will be adding content off and on for the next few weeks.<br /><br />The great thing about having the wiki is that White Peak Software now has single point of reference for accessing WPS information.  When a new sub-contractor comes on board, or even if I am looking for information about a particular project, the wiki site provides easy access to the needed information.  I’m glad I finally took the time to get this started.</p>

    <p>I received a DVD containing a database backup from a customer yesterday.  This morning I go to restore the database backup and I quickly realized I can’t.  My DVD drive is still packed away, which means it has been over 5 months since I have had to use it.  I didn’t realize until now how little I use physical media these days.  Downloads regardless of size are simply better for me.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I often rave about BDS2006 but not today.  Today this fine IDE is really annoying me.  I’m editing some ASP.NET User Controls (.ascx) using the markup editor.  Every time I save the changes the editor reformats the HTML to unformatted HTML.  Not only that it is inserting new HTML into the file such as empty &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; tags!  It’s annoying me so much I’m considering re-installing Visual Studio 2003.<br /><br />I don’t recall having this problem with BDS2005 and admittedly this is the first time I have done any major ASP.NET work in BDS2006.  Anyone know of a way to turn OFF HTML formatting in BDS2006?</p>
