    </h2>
    
    <p>Nik Kalyani of the DotNetNuke core team will be speaking at the next NYPC VB SIG on Wednesday, October 6.  I’ve heard Nik will be talking about the internals of the portal software and how to write your own extensions.  You should plan to attend if you have an interest in DotNetNuke.  I know I will be there.  The event starts at 6:15 PM at the Microsoft Office, 1290 6th Avenue, one block north of Radio City Music Hall.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Some of you may have noticed that the site was down today.  An unfortunate set of events prevented me from getting the site up sooner.  It all started this morning when I deployed a new version of the site software.
<br />
<br />I tested the changes on a Windows 2003 Server running .NET Framework v1.1.  However, the production environment is running .NET Framework v1.1 Service Pack 1.  Core pieces of the web site framework code that have been running problem free for years failed under Service Pack 1.  I fixed the code after trouble shooting the problems, but then came more problems.
<br />
<br />A series of network problems prevented me from deploying the fixes.  From an issue with my wireless access point to service provider issues, it seemed as if there was something that did not want me to deploy the fixes.  And to top it off, while talking with a prospect I asked that he visit the White Peak web site forgetting that the site was down.  Definitely not the image I want when talking with someone about building web applications.
<br />
<br />After a long day, the site is finally up and running.  The code is a bit better as a result, and I’m reminded of the importance of testing software in an environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible even for a site as simple as this one.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I had the pleasure of meeting <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/about/instructors/instructorbios.aspx?id=3">Jeffrey Richter</a> of Wintellect today during his full day talk on .NET Framework internals.  He talked on topics such as threading, asynchronous programming model, app domain, reflection, and key differences between C# and VB.NET.  His presentation style was entertaining, and I was amazed at his depth of knowledge around the .NET Framework.  I definitely learned more than a thing or two from Jeffrey.
<br />
<br />I ended my day with the monthly <a href="http://www.iccanyc.org/">ICCA</a> meeting featuring <a href="http://www.consultadhoc.com/">Liz Lynch</a> as tonight’s speaker.  Liz is a business management consultant and the author of <a href="http://www.consultadhoc.com/booklet.html">102 Secrets to Smarter Networking</a>.  She presented her approach for smarter networking, which is based on concepts of preparing, connecting, and strengthening.  Her advice was invaluable and will help me improve my networking skills.
<br />
<br />It’s been a great day of learning.  However, I’m exhausted and ready for bed.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I encounter a rather strange problem today.  I have a set of HTML files stored locally on my machine.  I can view each of the web pages in Fire Fox but not in IE.  Every time I attempted to open the HTML in IE, IE would report that the file was missing even though I knew it was on the hard drive.  I tried opening the file using the menu item File|Open from IE but it reported the same error message.  Finally I decided to load the HTML file into Visual Studio.NET.  To my surprise the file would not load and VS.NET would not report an error message.  If I attempted to load the file a second time in VS.NET, the IDE would simply lock forcing me to kill the process.
<br />
<br />After some detective work, I discovered the source of the problem.  Seems that each HTML file I attempted to open had a comment line near the top of the file that looked like this: <b><!-- saved from url=(0033) --></b>.  Apparently this is special information that Microsoft products such as IE and VS.NET look for.  I’m not sure how the information is used but I do know that neither tool reported meaningful messages regarding the commented line in the HTML file.
<br />
<br />To resolve the problem, I removed the saved from url lines from each HTML file.  IE and VS.NET are now happy as can be with regard to viewing these files.</p>

    <p>Here is a list of <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/addins/contact_management.htm">contact management tools</a> that provide integration with Outlook.  Business Contact Manager from Microsoft is working for me but others may be interested in other options.</p>

    <p>Users of Microsoft Business Contact Manager for Outlook 2003 should be careful when deleting accounts.  All business contacts linked to the account will be deleted when you delete the account.  And there is no warning message when deleting an account.  Simply highlight the account and press the delete key and your account and linked contacts are gone.
<br />
<br />From the menu bar, you can go to Business Tools | Others | Delete Items to see the delete account.  However the deleted contacts will not appear in the list.  The Delete Items feature seems like a nice idea but not really a useful.  Besides, there is no “undelete” feature.
<br />
<br />I highly recommend making a backup of your data prior to deleting any information in Business Contact Manager.  To make a backup go to File | Business Database | Backup on the Outlook menu bar and follow the instructions for making a local backup.
<br />
<br />Also, if you need to delete an account but want to keep the contacts, unlink the contacts from the account prior to deleting the account.  To unlink a contact, you must go to the business contact detail screen, click the “…” button for the account name, and click the “Clear Selection” button in the pop-up window.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Eric of <a href="http://www.deltapointsolutions.com/">Delta PointSolutions</a> recently turned me on to a new add-on for Outlook 2003 called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/contactmanager/prodinfo/default.mspx &lt;br  /&gt;"><br />“&gt;Business Contact Manager</a>.  I had recently migrated all my contact, calendar, and e-mail to software other than Outlook so I have the unfortunate joy of migrating everything back to Outlook.  But Business Contact Manager makes the move back worth while.
<br />
<br />A full fledge CRM solution is overkill for my organization <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> making Business Contact Manager ideal for me.  It allows you to manage business contacts, accounts, which are tied back to business contacts, and opportunities.  BCM gives you the ability to link e-mail messages, appointments, phone calls, and more to contacts, accounts, and opportunities making it much easier to find information.  And the auto link feature for e-mails is perfect for managing the countless e-mails that flow between me and my business contacts and accounts.
<br />
<br />The add-on is very easy to learn and those already familiar with Outlook 2003 will be up to speed in minutes.  It includes reporting capabilities, and helps small business owners manage opportunities.  The opportunities management is one of my favorite features of BCM.  I can track the progress, cost, sales stage and more.
<br />
<br />If you are a small business owner using Outlook 2003 and CRM are overkill for you, I suggest you check out Business Contact Manager.  It’s definitely worth the pain of migrating my information back into Outlook.</p>
