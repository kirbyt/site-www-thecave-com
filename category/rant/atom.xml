    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been a Meetup.com subscriber for years, but I hate using them. Their website isn’t very user-friendly, and I often times find their messages to be misleading and or confusing. For example during the transition of the <a href="http://www.nshappyhour.org">NSHappyHour</a> meetup, which had over 250 members, I tried to disable the account. Turns out that is not an option, or at least it wasn’t at the time. I learned that the account had been deleted when I went to re-enable the account a few days later. The only option was to start a new account. This meant we lost the 250+ members that has joined over the years, and we had no way of reaching out to those members to ask them to join the new meetup.</p>

<p>After that experience I decided I would not use Meetup.com again. But earlier this year I decided to start a new group, <a href="http://www.apres-code.com">Après Code</a>, and the best way to get the word out was to start another Meetup.com meet up. Meetup did help get the word out and people have been attending the gathering each month. But I still haven’t fully leveraged Meetup.com because the web interface is still just as confusing and crappy as ever. </p>

<p>Today I received yet another confusing, and misleading, message from Meetup.com that will cost a member $10, and I’m once again regretting my decision to use Meetup.com.</p>

<p>Apparently there is an option with Meetup to allow members to send a contribution. I thought this option was turned off, and according to my account settings contributions were not enabled. Yet, a member was still able to send a $10 contribution. I decided not to accept the contribution because it just seems weird to me to have someone spend me money for this meet up group. </p>

<p>I changed my mind this morning when I received the misleading email reminding me of the contribution. The Meetup email said, “You can choose to use it toward your Organizer Subscription.” My bi-annual subscription is due in a few days and I thought, sure, why not apply the $10 to the subscription amount. Turns out it’s not that simple.</p>

<p>With a single click of the mouse button, I started the process of accepting the contribution, but accepting the contribution means setting up a new account with some service named WePay and linking my bank account to WePay. This is not something I’m interested in doing. I know nothing about WePay. Not only that, WePay is taking $1.50 from the $10 contribution as a processing fee. That’s 15% of the contribution, which I find ridiculous. </p>

<p>Why can’t Meetup take the contribution and apply it directly to the Organizer Subscription? It seems like a simple enough task. After all, Meetup has the ability to process online credit card payments. And in doing this, members like me would not need to sign up for yet another service, link a bank account to a service they know nothing about, and the full contribution amount can be applied instead of only 85%.</p>

<p>So now I’m having to waste time contacting both Meetup and WePay requesting the member be refunded his contribution because Meetup misled me. And with my bi-annual subscription renewal coming up in a few days, I’m once agree debating whether I should continue using Meetup.com or not. I’m leaning towards not renewing, but I know if I don’t then they will delete the account and the members will be lost forever if I decide to renew later. And if I let the account expire before this contribution mess is resolved, the member who was kind enough to send the contribution will likely be out $10 and WePay will have an extra $10.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not I renew for another 6 months or not, I will not ever use Meetup.com again for any other group in the future. The subscription is not worth the hassle. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I woke up at 2:45 am this morning to buy a new Apple Watch. I ordered the 42mm space gray with black sport band Apple Watch Sport, but I’m still annoyed. I got a delivery date of May 13 to May 27, and that annoys me because I was ready to order at 3 am.</p>

<p>I was at my computer trying to load store.apple.com at 3 am, but the site was down. I foolishly kept refreshing the web page for 6 minutes before deciding to try the Apple Store app on my iPhone. The app worked perfectly, and thanks to Apple Pay, the order process was fast. But it was too late to get the watch I wanted in the first set of shipments, and all because I wasted my time trying to use the damn website.</p>

<p>I know, “first world problems.” All I can say is I’m grumpy when I have to use an alarm clock to wake up, and I become more grumpy when my time is wasted because of a website outage after waking up so freakin’ early.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve very disappointed in my new snowboard purchase. It’s fair to say I have a bad case of buyer’s remorse. I thought I was saving a few dollars by buying online, but at the same time I felt rushed. My gut was telling me not to do it. It told me to wait. But I didn’t listen. I’ll know better next time. </p>

<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7291/16512353495_71314188f0_n.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>My new board arrived yesterday, but I still cannot ride it. It’s missing the M6 hardware needed for my old bindings. Burton will send the hardware to me for free but it means going a few more days without riding the board. And if I were to buy the board today from AJ’s I would get a 25% discount and they would likely throw in the necessary hardware for my bindings for free. That said, I stopped by AJ’s to buy a pair of new bindings. </p>

<p>Why new bindings? I need something to feel good about with regards to this snowboard purchase. </p>

<p>Why feel bad? It’s not just the money. Turns out the board I bought is a Burton 2nd. This is a pre-production board. This means it has visual defects with the graphics. The board is just as good as a production board. It’s just that the graphic may or may not have blemishes. And my new board certainly has noticeable blemishes. </p>

<p>I feel a bit cheated because the site I bought the board from did not make it clear I was buying a 2nd. The product title had “Blem” at the end, but I had no idea that meant blemish. I certainly would not have bought the board had I known. </p>

<p>I thought about returning the board, but then I decided it was more trouble than it was worth. Plus it was my mistake for buying it, so I owned up to the mistake and decided to keep the board. But that’s also why I decided to buy the new bindings. I wanted something to feel good about with this entire messed up purchasing experience. And I have to say, I really like the new bindings. </p>

<p>I like the ride of the board too. I’m still getting use to it. I finally took it out for 3 run, wish I had had more time. The board feels like a craving machine. The board is a little longer than I’m use to, and I’m using a wider stance than before, but I’m sure I’m going to love this board as much if not more than my Malolo. </p>

<p>Also I learned something from the experience. Buy locally even if the price is slightly higher. Always check in-store locally for the best deals, don’t trust the website. And wait until February, or later, to buy new snowboard gear. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought a new Burton snowboard the other day. I ordered it online from a mom and pop shop in the Oregon. I wanted to buy locally here in Stowe but the price I paid was 10% cheaper than the price listed on the websites of local shops. Combined with the fact that I didn’t have to pay sales tax and shipping was free, I felt I was getting a great deal. Still, I would have preferred to support a local shop here in Vermont, but at least I supported a local shop in Oregon. </p>

<p>All good, right? Well…</p>

<p>My wife stopped by one of the local Stowe shops today to buy a pair of new skis. Turns out the shop has a sale going on…20% off all Burton boards! Turns out if I had bought my new board locally I would have saved more money than buying online. Plus I would have my board now instead of waiting until next week. </p>

<p>So why didn’t I buy locally given that the sale is going on? It’s because I didn’t know about the sale. Being the type of person I am, I check online before going into brick and mortar stores, and I checked the websites of the local Stowe shops before looking elsewhere. But the shop having the awesome sale did not advise the sale on their website. And because they didn’t advise the sale I ended up taking my business elsewhere.</p>

<p>What could this store have done to win my business? They could have shown the sale price on their website. And if they didn’t want to offer the sale price for online orders, then they could have advised the sale on the front page of their website. Something as simple as “20% Off All Snowboards” for in-store purchases only would have brought me into the store two days ago. And since they have the snowboard I want in stock, it would have been an easy sell. I would have been in and out of the store in under 10 minutes, and they would have a few hundred more dollars in the cash register.</p>

<p>Still, I’m happy with my purchase. With my online purchase I was able to support a locally owned, small business…granted in Oregon instead of Vermont, but that’s still better than buying from a big corporate retail chain. And while I spent more money with my online order, it was only $32 more than I would have paid locally when you add sales tax. So I didn’t lose out too much. The Stowe shop, and the state of Vermont for that matter, lost out more than I did and all because the shop didn’t update their website.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thecave.com/2014/09/03/dear-simple-its-you-not-me/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2014/09/03/dear-simple-its-you-not-me</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For more than a year and a half I’ve been in love with <a href="http://www.simple.com">Simple</a>, my online bank. From the very beginning it was as if Simple were designed specifically for me. Safe-to-spend and Goals changed how I managed and saved money, and it worked. It worked really well. So well in fact that I have more cash on hand today than I’ve had in years, and it’s all thanks to Simple. But something went wrong.</p>

<p>A month ago Simple did a major update to their backend system/platform, and since that dreadful day my financial world has been turned upside down. Payments were not sent while other scheduled payments simply disappear. My account balance has been all over the place. My account activity shows payments with the wrong payee name. And there have been times where the same debit appears in the account activity multiple times. It’s been a total nightmare.</p>

<p>For the last month I’ve been patient with Simple in hopes that they would resolve the problems caused by the platform upgrade, but instead of seeing improvements I continue to find and have more problems. I loved the Simple before the upgrade, but today I have zero confidence in Simple. And I don’t know how long it will be before I can trust Simple for my banking needs. Who knows, I may never trust them with my money again.</p>

<p>Following the advice of Simple’s own customer support representative, who said I should seek “alternative means of payment for the time being,” I decided to open a new account at <a href="http://ally.com">Ally</a>. It will take about a week before I have all my money moved over, but at least then I will know payments are going out as scheduled, and I do not have to worry about being late paying my rent.</p>

<p>I have to say I’m not thrilled about my breakup with Simple. Ally’s online experience is the same experience found with most other banks. Simple spoiled me with a better way (before the upgrade) to bank, and going back to a more traditional experience really sucks. But I would rather have a sucky online experience with a reliable bank than to have to worry about whether or not my bills are being paid on time.</p>

<p>Sorry Simple, but I must break up with you now. And it’s you, not me, that has caused this to happen. There might be a day in the future when we can get back together, but for the moment I  need a bank I can trust.</p>
