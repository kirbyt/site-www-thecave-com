    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you use <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a>? Ever wish you could quickly save a note to Evernote hands-free? Well, I found a way.</p>

<p>For nearly a year now, I’ve been using Evernote to store everything. Even the draft of this blog post was written using Evernote. As my dependency on Evernote grew, so did my need to quickly capture new ideas when I wasn’t near my computer. Sure, I can use my iPhone to save a note, but how do I save one when I can’t using my phone. What if I’m driving and an idea comes to mind that I want to capture. What then? Pull the car over just to use Evernote. Sorry, I’m obsessed with using Evernote, but not that obsessed.</p>

<p>Thankfully I found a way to record my ideas to Evernote that I can do it even while driving. All I do is say, “Hey Siri text Evernote…”</p>

<h1 id="how-it-works">How it works</h1>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> is an online service that lets you connect one service to another. It’s watching for actions from one service, and when they happen, it triggers an action in the other service. For instance, if you post a picture to Instagram, then save it to Dropbox. IFTTT can do that for you. It’s even in their name. IFTTT is If This, Then That. If I post a picture to Instagram, then save it to Dropbox. If This, Then That.</p>

<p>IFTTT supports incoming SMS messages. IFTTT can also save a note Evernote. I created an applet — that’s what IFTTT calls the rules that connect services together — that combines these two services. The applet accepts an incoming SMS message, then saves the message to Evernote.</p>

<p>IFTTT provides the phone number for the SMS message, which I added to my contacts list. I named the contact Evernote. Now, whenever I need to save an idea to Evernote quickly, I just send a text message to my Evernote contact. Cool, eh? Wait, it gets even cooler.</p>

<h1 id="hey-siri-text-evernote">Hey Siri, Text Evernote</h1>

<p>iPhone and Apple Watch have a nifty feature where you can say, “Hey Siri” and have Siri do some task for you. I use this all this time for things like setting a timer. “Hey Siri, set a 5 minute timer.” BAM! Siri sets a 5-minute timer for me. But Siri can do more. She can send a text message. Heck, she’ll even type the message as you speak. So while I’m driving, I raise my wrist and say into my Apple Watch, “Hey Siri, text Evernote, write a blog post on how I save ideas to Evernote without using my hands.” My watch sends the message to my iPhone, which sends out the SMS to IFTTT, which saves the message to Evernote.</p>

<p>Pretty dang cool, eh?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want an easy way to share certain posts to social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, at the time I publish the post. The more I can automate, the better. The problem is this site is a static HTML site generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>.</p>

<p>So how do I automatically share a post to Facebook or Twitter? That’s what I’m experimenting with right now, and this post is my test post.</p>

<h2 id="whats-going-on">What’s Going On</h2>

<p>For the techies reading this, here’s what I’m doing.</p>

<p>First, I updated my tags plugin to generate an RSS feed file for each tag. Next, I setup <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> to monitor the feed files for the tags “facebook” and “twitter”. When IFTTT detects a new feed file item (i.e., a new blog post), it will post the item to the appropriate social media site. If I want to share a post to Facebook, I simply tag it with “facebook”. And if I want to share the post on Twitter, I tag it with “twitter”.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com">source code for this site</a> is available on <a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com">Github</a> for those who want to look under the hood.</p>

<p>Now to start work on the hard part…writing more blog posts.</p>

    <updated>2016-11-19T10:52:31-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2016/11/19/from-trace-to-slopes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m a software developer but I’m also a snowboard bum. And with the start of the 2016/2017 snowboard season upon us – that is, for those of us living in the Northern Hemisphere – I’m eager to hit the slopes. Over the last few years I’ve used <a href="http://www.traceup.com/trace-for-snow">Trace Snow</a>, formerly AlpineReplay, to track my time on the slopes. It’s a good iPhone app but far from perfect. One feature it lacks is reporting the number of days spent on the slopes in a season. Trace isn’t alone in not having this feature. None of the ski and snowboard tracking apps I’ve tried have this feature. It seems these apps are more commonly used by individuals who only get a small number of days on the slopes, say 5 or 10 days, which is easy to count. But when you average 80+ days each season, counting the number of days can be a pain.</p>

<p>As luck would have it I had the pleasure of meeting <a href="https://curtisherbert.com">Curtis Herbert</a> at this year’s 360idev. For those who don’t know Curtis, he’s an iOS developer who just happens to have written an excellent ski and snowboard tracking app appropriately named <a href="https://getslopes.com">Slopes</a>.</p>

<p>I tried Slopes once last year, but I wasn’t won over by it. I don’t remember the reasons, but I do remember it was lacking the one feature I really wanted, which is the see the number of days I’ve ridden in a season. I mentioned this to Curtis and before the end of the conference Slopes had a day count feature. And Curtis had a new customer. I decided right away I would use Slopes this season instead of Trace.</p>

<p>That said, I was bummed that I could not use Slopes to view the years of data I had collected in Trace. I mentioned this in email to Curtis and within a minute he replied telling me about Slopes’ import process. “Wow,” I thought, “he’s thought of everything.”</p>

<p>I immediately went to the Trace website to see if I could export my data, and sure enough I could. But there was a problem. I had to export each day one at a time. I’ve logged over 250 days in Trace and manually downloading each day was not something I wanted to do. So I put on my developer hat and wrote a python script that <a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/trace-export">downloads the GPX files from Trace</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> is the perfect language for a task like this especially when combined with <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a>, a Python library for parsing HTML. I’ve written similar screen scraping scripts using Python and Beautiful Soup before, so writing a script that downloads the GPX files from the Trace site took me a fraction of the time it would have taken me to manually download each GPX file.</p>

<p>With my Trace data in hand I was ready to import the GPX files into Slopes, but I hit another wall. To import a GPX file into Slopes, you email the file to yourself, then on your iPhone, you open the GPX file in Slopes. This is a great process if you have one or two GPX files to import, but if you have hundreds, well, it’s less than ideal. But thankfully Curtis thought that too. You can use <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301">iTunes File Sharing</a> to import GPX files. Simply tether your iPhone to your Mac, open iTunes, select your iPhone, select the Apps section in the left panel, and scroll down to the File Sharing section in the right panel (thanks, Apple, for making this not so straight forward). Select the Slopes app, then drag and drop your GPX files into the Slopes Documents area. Finally, launch the Slopes app on your iPhone. Slopes was able to import all my files in a matter of seconds, and now I have all my tracked data, dating back to the 2012/2013 snowboard season, in Slopes.</p>

<p>Now, if you are a Slopes user too and you previously used Trace, you can use my Python script to <a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/trace-export">download your past GPX recordings</a>. I open sourced it so others can quickly download their data.</p>

<p>As for Slopes, I have to say it’s a great app and Curtis is awesome. He has thought of just about everything for Slopes, and for those features not in it, he seems like the type of guy who will add them if it makes sense for the app and its users. In fact one feature missing that I’ve already requested is an option to export all my GPX data from Slopes. I don’t plan to stop using Slopes anytime soon, but I would still like to see this feature on the off chance I have to make another switch in the future.</p>
