    <ul><br /><li>Ever have one of those days where you can't seem to get into your work even though you are under enormous pressure to certain tight deadlines?  I'm having one of those days today, which means my brain is trying to tell me to take a break.</li><br /><li>SQLite is an awesome DBMS for single user, desktop applications.  I had the opportunity to use SQLite, well, a Delphi favor called <a href="http://www.zeitungsjunge.de/delphi/sqlite3/">DISQLite3</a> in a project a few weeks ago.  The program I wrote called for reading data from multiple CSV files and sending data back out to two more CSV files.  The problem I was having was managing data relationships in memory.  SQLite and <a href="http://www.zeitungsjunge.de/delphi/sqlite3/">DISQLite3</a> to the rescue!  I imported the CSV data into the SQLite relational database then exported data using SQL queries.  I'm now looking for more reasons to use DISQLite3.</li><br /><li>I downloaded and installed the <a href="http://services.google.com/adwordseditor/">Google AdWords Editor</a>.  This neat desktop application makes it easier to manage your AdWord campaigns without having to go through the Web interface.  I recommend this program to anyone who needs to make frequent changes to AdWords campaigns.</li><br /><li>Only 17 days remain before the release of <a href="http://www.turboexplorer.com/">Turbo Delphi</a>.  I wonder if the new DevCo investor will be announced that same day.</li><br /><li>I'm working on a new web site for a <a href="http://www.capturethecork.com/">beer drinking game</a> Josh, Brooke, and I invited last year.  The site still needs lots of work especially on the copy, but it's a start.</li><br /></ul>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Earlier this year I ranted about <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2006/01/16/why_no_free_personal_edition_of_borland_developer_studio.aspx">Borland not offering a free personal edition of Borland Developer Studio</a>, and more specifically <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi/">Delphi</a>.  A few months later a trial version was made available for download.  But the new DevCo is going one step further with the upcoming release of the <a href="http://www.turboexplorer.com/">Turbo editions of Delphi, Delphi.NET, C++, and C#</a>.<br /><br />The single language Turbo editions come in two flavors, Explorer and Professional.  Explorer is FREE while Professional will be less than $500 (and less then $100 for students).  The only restriction in the Explorer addition is the fixed component palette.  In other words, the Explorer edition, which comes with hundreds of pre-built components will not allow you use to 3rd party components.  But that’s okay because it is FREE.<br /><br />The return of single language Turbo editions is exciting news.  Now all those others developers who hear me preach about the wonders of Delphi will have a chance to give Turbo Delphi a spin at no cost.  And once they discover the power they will be able to buy the professional edition at a reasonable price.<br /><br />For me, I plan to stick with Borland Developer Studio because I need to multi-language support.  But I’m still excited about the new opportunities the Turbo editions will create.<br /><br />Go DevCo!</p>

        <a href="/2006/08/12/last-2-weeks/">Last 2 Weeks</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>I’ve been away for the last two weeks, which means I have a back log of emails waiting for responses.  Since it will be a few days before I can answer all of the emails I thought I sled light on what has happened over the last two weeks and the events that caused me to go dark.<br /><br /><b>Rip VanWinkle</b><br /><br /><img src="http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/theripvanwinkles.jpg" border="0" alt="VanWinkle Family" width="324" height="243" align="right" /><br />First, my cousin Michael, aka Rip, aka Mike, died unexpectedly on Sunday, June 30.  Michael and I grew up together and he was like a brother to me.  I haven’t seen Michael as much as I would have liked over the last few years because I live in the Northeast and he was in Jackson, Tennessee.  I only saw him, and his awesome wife and daughters once or twice a year.  But I still think of him often and exchange the occasional email, phone call and text messages from time to time throughout the year.<br /><br />It’s been almost two weeks since I got the phone call about Michael and there is still a part of me that is in disbelief.  I believe this is due in part to the fact that we only saw each other a couple of times a year.  But I know it is going to hit me, as it already had a few times, when I don’t receive any more picture emails Rip’s cute daughters, or I don’t hear his laugh at the next Redneck Shindig.  <br /><br />I love you and miss you.  Farwell buddy.  <br /><br /><b>Time Away</b><br /><br />After receiving the news about Michael, my wife Melanie and I headed down to Memphis to be with the family.  It was a very emotional week, which left Melanie and me both thinking a lot about death.  We had a vacation planned for the week of the unfortunate event so we postponed it by one week.  This gave Melanie and me time to talk to each other about Michael, death, funerals, family, and so on.  But we also enjoyed some time being disconnected from the world.<br /><br />We went to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/acad/">Acadia National Park</a> on Mount Desert Island in Maine.  We stayed at the <a href="http://www.bassharbor.com/">Bass Harbor campgrounds</a>, which is a great place to stay by the way.  We rode bikes through the carriage roads of Acadia, drove up to the summit of Cadillac Mountain, dipped our toes in the frigid ocean waters, took a swim in Echo Lake, ate lobster, and saw amazing sceneries.  It was the perfect getaway.<br /><br />On the drive back home from Acadia we decided to surprise the Davis clan by making a quick visit to Killington, Vermont.  Melanie’s whole family was there.  Seeing them was a great way to end the events of the last two weeks.<br /><br />We’re back in Salem now, which means a return to reality of emails, work travel and more new security changes at airport ports.  May be it’s time for the whole world to take a vacation, disconnect, and get a fresh to outlook on things.</p>

    <p>According to the Microsoft blogger Somasegar, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/07/28/681224.aspx">Windows Vista will support more than 7,000 new native APIs</a>.<br />&lt;div class="quote"&gt;<br />Here is a trivia for you.  We have added more than 7,000 new native APIs for Windows developers in Windows Vista.

    <p>Kevin Downs, of <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/">NDoc</a> fame, has decided to <a href="http://johnsbraindump.blogspot.com/2006/07/ndoc-20-is-dead.html">stop work on NDoc</a>.  One reason is the lack of love from the .NET community.  This widely used open source tool for generating source code documentation from .NET applications has received very few community contributions and from what I gathered even less financial support.  And to make matter worse Kevin was the victim of a mail-bomb attack believed to be directed at him for not providing .NET 2.0 support fast enough.<br /><br />I’m not surprised at the lack of community support but the mail-bomb attack is just plan insane.  I don’t blame Kevin for stepping down.</p>
