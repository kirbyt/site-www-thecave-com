    </h2>
    
    <p>After 5 days in 5 cities, I am finally flying home.  The week has been fun albeit tiring with days running 14 to 16 hours.  Admittedly, even with the long days this was one of those weeks that left me thinking “I like my job.”  Granted, I would not want to do this every week.
<br />
<br />Speaking at the councils definitely improved my public speaking skills and gave me increased confidence along with an ego boost.  If giving the opportunity, I would definitely do it again.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.thecave.com/gallery/20030314-MS%20Architect%20Council/IMG_0844.JPG"><img src="http://www.thecave.com/gallery/20030314-MS%20Architect%20Council/IMG_0844.JPG" width="120" height="90" border="0" align="left" /></a>There were many highlights from the week.  One of which was <a href="http://orlando.diningguide.net/data/d101871.htm">Vito’s Chop House</a> in Orlando.  The  steaks were amazing and mine was perfectly cooked to my preference, which is hard given that I prefer blue or black blue as they call it at Vito’s.  The <a href="http://www.hardrock.com/locations/hotels/orlando/">Hard Rock Hotel</a> in Orlando was also a highlight and is a very cool hotel.  Sadly we did not get to stay the night though.  Guess Melanie and I will have to make a weekend trip to Orlando soon.  I know where we will be eating and staying.  And the Renaissance Hotel in Boca was great and offered excellent wireless access to the Internet for free.  However, I do not recommend the restaurant Porter’s, which is attached to the hotel.
<br />
<br />My favorite comment from the week happened when Tom asked the group “What is a ‘dirty read’?”  I whispered Hustler and Sluts with Big Thingies.  When asked “And what is bad about dirty reads?” Ian whispered “Sticky pages.”  LOL.  Oh too funny.  Guess you have to be a geek to get it.</p>

    <p>I’ve said it before and I will say it again, I enjoy working with the folks from Microsoft.  I am one of three speakers at the Microsoft Architect Council in the Gulf States.  My talk is on Interop with Web Services, and I’m having a good time interacting with the audience.</p>

    <p>On the road again tomorrow visiting my two least favorite States, Alabama and Florida.  The 5 day, 5 city tour begins in Birmingham, followed by Jacksonhell.  I don’t know why this city rubs me wrong.  It just does.  Wednesday I will be in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa on Thursday, Orlando on Friday, returning to the city Friday night.  Should be a fun week.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Okay, I’m depressed.  Next week I am joining Microsoft for a 5 day/5 city tour to talk about interop with Web services.  I have spent the last couple of days writing sample code for my demos and was nearing completion when I lost everything.
<br />
<br />How did I lost it all?  Simple.  I re-ran the wstkconfig.bat from the IBM Web Services Toolkit to deploy the last Web service I planned to show.  The other code was manually deployed but this time I decided to use the configuration tool just for fun.  Little did I know it would delete the entire webapps/wstk directory, which contained the majority of my code that I manually deployed.  All that work gone.  Guess it’s time to start over.
<br />
<br />Be warned: If using the IBM Web Services Toolkit, keep your original source in a safe place on the hard drive.  That is, keep it in a place not under the live webapps.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Whew! What a day.  I lost all my demo code for next week but I finally got it all re-created.  Definitely some cool things happening in Java with regard to Web services.  My favorite tool is Wsdl2Java.  This generates a set of proxy classes for consuming a Web service and is a great time saver.  Java2Wsdl on the other hand is a pain in the ass.  I never got it working, but luckily Axis will auto-generate a WSDL for your service using a ?WSDL parameter on a HTTP GET request.
<br />
<br />I finally have a demo environment setup that illustrates inteorp between .NET and Java 2 Platforms, and I have WS-Security working between Microsoft’s WSE and IBM’s WSTK.  I must say that WSKT is poorly documented at the moment, which was a pain.  Oh, and it seems that WSTK does not like the MustUnderstand attribute.  Be sure to set that puppy to false if you are digitally signing a service request where the producer is using WSTK.
<br />
<br />Overall, cool stuff.  And I am glad I finally have a decent work environment for showing off the various technologies.</p>

    <p>Day 4 on Killington was very nice.  The snow had soften up a bit.  Runs of the day: Rim in the morning and the Chute in the afternoon.  Also Great Bear was a blast and was the only trail I know of that still have evidence on Sunday’s snow storm.  It’s un-groomed and has soft powder bumps.
<br />
<br />Melanie and I leave Killington today.  She flies out to Brussels tonight and I have to finish work on my demos for next week’s 5 day/5 city tour with Microsoft.  I had planned to hit the slopes this morning for a few quick runs before leaving because the weather forecast was calling for a wintery mix, but it’s looks like that will not happen.  And if I am going out for only an hour then I want to see new snow or at least a change in the conditions.  Oh well.  We will be back very soon.</p>
