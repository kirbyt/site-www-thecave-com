This blog posting by <a href="http://delphi-notes.blogspot.com/">Daniel Wischnewski</a> really caught my attention.  He has successfully ported an <a href="http://delphi-notes.blogspot.com/2006/05/first-time-delphi-aspnet-application.html">ASP.NET application written in Delphi.NET to a Linux environment running Mono and Apache</a>.  This really doesn't surprise me because I have in the past run .NET assemblies under Mono without a problem.  But at the same time I find it very cool that it is an ASP.NET application written in <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a>, which is something I haven't yet tried.  Awesome stuff.
