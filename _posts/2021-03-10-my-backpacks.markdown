Ten years ago I had over 30 backpacks and bags. I was what you might call a bag whore. But I decided to downsize. I got rid of almost all my bags, keeping only a few that served multiple purposes. For example, my GORUCK GR1 became my every day carry, my laptop bag, and my travel bag. In fact, after buying my GR1 I told my wife it will likely be the last backpack I ever buy. 

Boy was I wrong.

Over the last decade, I've slowly collected more packs again. I was down to two backpack ten years ago but today I'm up to ten. And that's just backpacks. I'm not counting other bags such as duffles and snowboard travel bags.

Here's the list of backpacks I currently own:

## What Isn't in the List

I didn't include the snowboard bags I have, though I'm down to one after giving away five of them last fall. I didn't include the duffle bags I own. I have three of them. I didn't include my [Burton Beeracuda](https://www.burton.com/us/en/p/beeracuda/W19-149461.html) or storage bag for snowshoes. Or one of my all time favorite bags, the [Red Oxx Air Boss](https://www.redoxx.com/air-boss-91018/p). I love my Air Boss and I refuse to get rid of it even though I haven't used it in more than ten years.
