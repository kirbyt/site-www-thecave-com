I returned from my second trip using the GR1, and I can now say the <a href="https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3">GORUCK GR1</a> is now my favorite everyday backpack. My latest trip was to WWDC, and the GR1 kicked ass. I packed everything I needed for the week in the ruck, and I used it as my daypack each day at the conference. I especially like how slim the bag is even when stuffed full. I had no problems sliding it in and out from under the seat on the plane. And the zippers are quiet enough when opening and closing as to not disturb those sitting around me at the conference during talks.

Here was my packing list for the conference:

<ul>
<li>5 T-shirts</li>
<li>A pair of flip-flops.</li>
<li>A paid of Five Finger shoes.</li>
<li>A rain jacket.</li>
<li>A pack towel (don't forget your towel)</li>
<li>A pair of jeans.</li>
<li>Boxes and extra socks (for the sneakers I worn to and from SF)</li>
<li>15" MacBook Pro (circa 2007, not one of those uber cool new ones)</li>
<li>Power supply and extended power cord for the MBP</li>
<li>Ethernet cable</li>
<li>iPad</li>
<li>Headphones</li>
<li>Charging cables, styluses, Square</li>
<li>Tooth brush, toothpaste, deodorant, soap</li>
<li>Beard trimmer and beard comb</li>
<li>Buttons and pins for lanyard flare</li>
<li>Extra field guide</li>
<li>A buff</li>
</ul>

Also, I attached a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086UBPDM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0086UBPDM">Condor H2O pouch</a> to my GR1 to carry my water bottle on the plane ride. And I put the stuff in my pockets (wallet, iPhone, field notes, pen, pocket flashlight, and Fitbit) into the pouch when going through TSA security. I love that I can expand my GR1 as needed like this using the molle webbing. I took the H2O pouch off during the week while attending the conference since my water bottle fit fine in the bag.

The only issue I had was returning home with extra shirts and the WWDC jacket. I didn't have the needed space for the extra stuff, so the WWDC jacket and a couple of pairs of boxers went into a sack that I carried. Next year I'll remember to leave room for swag on the return trip.

My first trip with the GR1 was to Arkansas with my son to go car camping with my dad, brother, and his son. While the GR1 performed well on this trip, it wasn't a good test for me since I was not traveling light on that trip. Most of the gear was checked for the plane ride since it was camping gear. Still, the pack served me well on that trip.
