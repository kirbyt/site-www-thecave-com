Microsoft recently announced .NET 3.0 which is basically the .NET 2.0 Framework with the WinFX library.  This has caused a lot of confusion in the software developer community and is in my opinion a stupid move by Microsoft.  Turns out I'm not alone in thinking this was a bad move.  A petition has been started to <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/winfx/petition.html">reverse the WinFX .NET naming</a>.
