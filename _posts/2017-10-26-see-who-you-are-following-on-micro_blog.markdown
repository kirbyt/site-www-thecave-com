I discovered you can see the list of people a person follows on [Micro.blog][1], including yourself. It seems the feature is only available in the [Micro.blog for Mac][3] app. Using it, click a person's avatar. Under the bio section, you'll see "Following n" where n is the number of people that the person follows. Click it to see the list of people. Thanks, [@manton][2], for giving us another way to discover people on Micro.blog.
