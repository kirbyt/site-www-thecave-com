Last month Shawn and I hiked Division 1 of the Long Trail.  The hike was mostly enjoyable - we had to cut the trip short which meant hiking in the dark with pouring rain and high winds.  That part was not enjoyable.  But the trail is clearly marked making the night hike easier than expect.<br /><br />Here are <a href="http://photos.thecave.com/gallery/6462530_g93i8/1/409902560_U4g2h">pictures</a> from the trip.  If I have more time in the near future I will blog more about the trip.
