Wow! It's nearly the end of 2020 and I'm making my first blog post of the year. It's been more than a year since my last post. There's no excuse for going this long without a post, but I have one anyways. I broke my local install in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which is the software I use to generate this website. And I've been too busy with work to make the time to fix the issues. But I started a 2-week vacation yesterday and thought, "I should fix my blog site."

Fixing the software issues that prevented me from blogging solves only half of the problem. The other half that I must solve is actually blogging. Taking the time to write something and post it here. Or post a picture. I have lots of pictures from 2020, but I haven't posted a single one here.
