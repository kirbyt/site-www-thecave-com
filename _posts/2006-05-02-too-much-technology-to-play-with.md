Some days I find it hard to stay focused.  There are many new technologies to play with and I want to spend time with them all.  I'm itching to install the latest version of <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">DotNetNuke</a> and see what has changed in the last year.  I also want to port a web part I wrote for SharePoint from C# to <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi/">Delphi</a> and make it a DNN module.  There's also a few Ajax frameworks I want to experiment with, and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html">GData</a> (Google Data API) is something I'm really, really anxious to play with.<br /><br />The fun doesn't stop there.  Microsoft's Windows Workflow Foundation and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) are peaking my interest too.  /n software isn't helping my focus problem either by releasing a new <a href="http://www.nsoftware.com/workflow/">workflow</a> and <a href="http://www.nsoftware.com/ssis/">SSIS</a>.  Just more fun stuff to play with.<br /><br />Maybe I need a new <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> company policy allowing 8 hours per week to "technology play time".
