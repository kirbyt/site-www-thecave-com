I first heard about [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) back in April. I liked it so much, I decided to host my own Mastodon instance. Thus, [thecave.social](https://www.thecave.com/2017/04/12/mastodon-and-thecavesocial/) was born. 

I had a lot of fun playing with my own Mastodon instance, and I learned a lot. I even thought I might open up it up to other users. But alas, I haven't had a lot of spare time since [May 1](https://www.thecave.com/2017/05/01/im-trying-something-different/). I don't even remember the last time I checked in on thecave.social. That's why I decided to shut it down today.

If you are looking for me on a social network, you can find me at [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/kirbyt). Of course, you can find those same [microposts](https://www.thecave.com/tag/micropost/) right here at [thecave.com](https://www.thecave.com/).
