A friend of mine told me this morning she quit her job and is now freelancing as an iOS developer. She asked if I had any advice to share. The first thoughts to pop into my mind were:

- Read all you can from [Brennan Dunn](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com)
- Read all you can from [Jonathan Stark](https://expensiveproblem.com)
- Read all you can from [Ryan Waggoner](http://ryanwaggoner.com)
- Subscribe to Matt Inglot's [Freelance Transformation podcast](https://freelancetransformation.com)

Also, I talked about my workflow for finding new freelance work at last year's [360idev](https://360idev.com) conference. Unfortunately, the video recording got corrupted, so you can't watch the talk. But I do have a [PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wo4r3jnjnilguzu/freelancers-guide-to-finding-work.pdf?dl=0) of slide deck that includes a transcript of the talk that some might find helpful.
