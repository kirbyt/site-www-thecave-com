    </h2>
    
    <p>“This is a warning for any creator of computer programs: that software quality matters, that applications must be foolproof, and that-whether embedded in the engine of a car, a robotic arm in a factory or a healing device in a hospital-poorly deployed code can kill.”
<br />
<br />This quote comes from an article my friend Matt pointed to me from Base Line Magazine titled <a href="http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,1397,1543564,00.asp">Why Software Quality Matters</a>.
<br />
<br />This article really illustrates the importance of software quality.  As more software is used in the daily lives of people the importance of quality software increases.  Recently I read in Consumer Reports that a particular model of luxury car is being recalled due to a problem related to a transmission controller chip.  The software in this chip can cause the car moving forward to shift into reverse.  Imagine the pileup that could be caused by a car suddenly shifting into reverse as it and other drivers speed down the NJ Turnpike during rush hour.
<br />
<br />Many programmers like me can and have argued that our business applications pose no threat to human life.  But does this mean we can set quality levels for our work to a lower standard?  Does it mean we can intentionally deploy poorly written applications?  I say absolutely not!  Software developers must start accepting the responsibility of writing high quality code and they should be held accountable for any code not adhering to a high standard of quality.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I was a grumbling VB developer for a number of years.  At the time Delphi was my language of choice but in the part of the country I lived customer work using it was almost non-existent.  In the summer of 2000 at PDC, a friend of mine from Microsoft showed me the .NET Framework and C#.  I was instantly drawn to C# because it reminded me of Delphi, which is no surprise for those who know their <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HistoryOfCsharp">C#/Delphi history</a>.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Over the last month a lot of my time has been spent focusing on security as I design a security framework and strategy for a customer.  One comment I hear often is “we don’t need to worry about internal security threats” or “internal security threats are minor and represent a low priority”.  I couldn’t disagree more and have been repeatedly emphasizing the importance of protecting ones assets from internal attacks, which for some companies is a greater threat.
<br />
<br />Yesterday’s <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1616668,00.asp?kc=ewnws062404dtx1k0000599">report</a> of an AOL software engineer being arrested for stealing 92 million customer screen names proves my point.  Some people will do crazy things when offered enough money.  And companies that believe “it won’t happen here” or “our employees would never do such a thing” are fooling themselves.  Why risk it?  Invest in reducing security threats, both external and internal.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/12/1379.aspx">agree</a> with Scott.  Unit Testing support should be included with all versions of Visual Studio 2005 and not just with Team System.  However, I am not sure I agree with the unit testing support using a new framework developed by Microsoft.  <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> is here today and works with all released versions of the .NET Framework.  And I am sure support for version 2 of the .NET Framework will be included in NUnit once Microsoft has released it.<br /><br />I doubt many of my customers will be ready to move to VS.NET 2005 and the .NET Framework 2.0 when it is released, but I will still be developing solutions for them.  And I will continue to provide unit tests for custom written production code.  So while I agree that all versions of Visual Studio.NET 2005 should include support for unit testing, I would like to see stronger support for NUnit and not some new testing framework.  This will help ease the migration to the new tool and framework.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    <p>For those new to Firefox, be sure to check out the list of <a href="http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/">extensions</a>.  They’re easy to install and there are many helpful extensions that will improve your browsing experience.  As a matter of fact, I’m using the BlogThis! extension right now to post this entry.</p>

        <a href="/2004/06/17/firefox-0-9-available-for-download/">Firefox 0.9 Available for Download</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>While nothing really new, other than security updates has happened to IE in quite some time, Mozilla has continued work on its next generation web browser called Firefox.  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox 0.9</a> is available for download and I feel it is a worth while download.<br /><br />I have been running Firefox as my default browser for the last 24 hours.  I really like tab browsing and how Firefox blocks pop-up windows.  It works fine for almost all sites I visit including a Microsoft SharePoint Window Services 2.0 site that I use daily.  I don’t get the drop down command list on SharePoint documents like I would in IE but I’m still able to do everything I need with a document through the document design page.<br /><br />My only complaint to date is when I attempt to open a link in a new window from SharpReader, the RSS aggregator I use.  For some reason the web page is displayed in both a Firefox window and an IE window.  I doubt this is the fault of SharpReader and is more the fault of the IE component used within SharpReader.  In other words, I think the IE component is launching the additional IE window when Firefox is set as my default browser.<br /><br />Aside from that one problem, I enjoy browsing with Firefox based on my 24 hour experience and will probably keep it as my default browser for a while.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    <p>Microsoft has published the latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vssmap.asp">Visual SourceSafe Roadmap</a>, which outlines where VSS is heading with the release of Visual SourceSafe 2005.  The new version will still be geared towards individual developers and small teams, i.e., teams with less than 5 developers but it will finally include remote access.  I’m glad to see VSS is finally getting a much needed upgrade but I doubt the new release will convince me to switch back from <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>.<br /><br /><br /></p>
