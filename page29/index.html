        <a href="/2006/06/21/native-windows-code-is-here-for-a-while/">Native Windows Code Is Here for a While</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>I’m one of those rare developers who have moved from .NET managed code to native Windows code over the last year.  After living in the managed code world for years, I’ve returned to native windows coding and I find I am doing more and more native Win32 work each month for customers.  Sure the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/products.aspx">products White Peak Software</a> is writing are native Windows applications but recently customers have been <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/custom_software.aspx">asking White Peak Software to develop native Win32 custom software</a>.  The most common reason?  The desire to eliminate the dependency on the .NET Framework.  <br /><br />I often hear, “We don’t know if the server hosting your program will have the .NET Framework installed,” or “The end users do not have .NET installed on their desktops so we need something that will run without .NET.”<br /><br />Now don’t get me wrong.  I love .NET.  It’s a great framework, but there is something to be said for native Windows applications.  And there are still many cases where a native Windows application should be written instead of a .NET equivalent.  For instance, I feel .NET applications are ideal for in-house development typically found in corporations, and I feel commercial applications are typically better served as a native Windows application.  Of course there are always exceptions to my general thinking, hence the <a href="http://suretalent.blogspot.com/2006/06/resurgence-in-native-windows.html">recent resurgence seen at White Peak Software</a> in customer requests for <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/custom_software.aspx">custom native Windows applications</a>.  <br /><br />Don’t believe me?  Think everything running on the Windows platform should be managed code?  Well, individuals at Microsoft know that native Windows applications are staying around for a while.  When the IE Lead Project Manager Christopher Vaughan was recently asked <a href="http://www.matasano.com/log/332/matasano-interviews-ie-lead-pm-christopher-vaughan">if components of the new IE7 would be implemented in managed code</a> his response was, “No, IE7 remains purely native code throughout. I think as we develop future versions of IE you’ll see a larger focus on managed code, most likely to enable great plug-ins of that type for our platform. One thing people shouldn’t expect is that IE8 be re-written in managed code. For a variety of reasons, native code is where we’ll stay for a while.”</p>

        <a href="/2006/06/18/microsofts-project-gildepath/">Microsoft's Project Gildepath</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>Microsoft has created a new web site called <a href="http://www.projectglidepath.net/">Project Glidepath</a>.  As I understand it, the goal of the site is to help small software companies to get up to speed on the flurry of new technologies coming from Microsoft such as Windows Vista and WPF.<br /><br />From the web site’s home page:<br /><br />“The release of Windows Vista will create a new wave of demand for applications that MicroISVs supply. We at Microsoft know how many new features and APIs we have added to Windows Vista as well as we understand how challenging it is to start and keep a MicroISV business running. Project Glidepath is designed to provide the knowledge you, as a MicroISV, need to be successful by providing step-by-step instructions for everything from how to get started with Windows Presentation Foundation to how to write and publish a press release.”<br /><br /><a href="http://safarisoftware.typepad.com/">Bob Walsh</a>, author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596013/whitepeaksoft-20/104-8498544-1888714?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1">Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality</a> is involved in this project, which says to me it is worth some time to check out what is being offered at Project Glidepath if you are running a small software company.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I biggest compliant, and possibly our only compliant, since moving to the Boston area is driving in the Boston area.  I some times think the area has the worse drivers in the Nation, but it’s not the fault of the drivers.  Poor signage…actually the lack of street signs in many places…construction, construction, construction, poor markings on the roads, and more have probably contributed to creating bad drivers.  Just the other day I saw two slow speed accidents.  Yes, cars travelling at about walking speed collided.  I didn’t see this happen once, but twice within a 30 minutes time period.<br /><br />It’s no surprise to me that the Boston area doesn’t even have a safety ranking in the AllState <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12954585/">best driver report for 2006</a>.  Okay, to be fair <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12948178/">AllState does not issue car insurance here</a> which is why the Boston area is not on the report.  But still.<br /><br />So what’s the point of this blog entry?  Simple.  I cracked up this morning when I read <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/">Erik Sink</a>’s entry on <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/TechEd_2006_Report.html">Notes from TechEd in Boston</a>.  Further proof that driving in the Boston area is a real pain.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I have been doing more <a href="http://www.quickbase.com/">QuickBase</a> work lately.  I really like QuickBase but the <a href="https://www.quickbase.com/up/6mztyxu8/g/rc7/en/va/QuickBaseAPI.htm">HTTP API</a> can be a bit hairy.  Intuit provides various language specific SDKs for the QuickBase API but <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> is not included.  So I’m writing my own.  [I’ll post the code to the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> site as soon as it is done.]</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I received an email today from <a href="http://www.esellerate.net/">eSellerate</a> saying that they are now part of the Digital River team.  I’m not sure how I feel about this news.  I have been using eSellerate for a year now and I’m a very happy eSellerate customer.  Their services are great, and I haven’t even tapped into everything they offer yet.  <br /><br />My concern with today’s announcement is that I decided last year not to go with Digitial River or any of its other companies as the e-commerce provider for <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>.  I don’t remember the details of why I didn’t chose them, but I do remember thinking eSellerate was the better choice for my company.  Had this acquisition happened a year ago would I have still chosen eSellerate?  I don’t know.<br /><br />The announcement from eSellerate did say, “Be assured that we plan to provide the same personal level of service you have come to expect from all of us here at eSellerate. Your eSellerate technical support, sales, development, and management teams will continue supporting you from our Lincoln, Nebraska headquarters.”  This is good to know, but only time will tell if the acquisition is a good thing for eSellerate and their customers.</p>

    <p>Is <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/04/04/77113_HNnetsoldown_1.html">Network Solutions down again</a> for a third time this year?  It appears so.  Their web site is unreachable and the domain names I have stored in Network Solution’s DNS do not resolve.  I know my servers are up because I can reach them by IP address.<br /><br />I’ve been happy with Network Solutions over the years, and I haven’t minded paying the premium price for their service.  But if this trend continues then I may have no choice but to move my domain names to another registrar.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> After what appeared to be approximately a 30-minute outage, Network Solutions and its services are back online.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Another Update:</span> Well, DNS is at least back.  Access to the <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">www.networksolutions.com</a> web site still appears to be a problem.  At least this confirms to me that the outage I saw a little while ago is related to problems at Network Solutions.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">www.networksolutions.com</a> is back online as well.</p>
