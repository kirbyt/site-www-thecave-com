    </h2>
    
    <p>Monday night my wife and I made a last minute decision to make a quick trip to <a href="http://www.killington.com/">Killington</a> for one last day of snowboarding.  Well, skiing for her.  We hit the slopes yesterday and had a blast.  But our 2006/2007 season has officially come to an end.  <br /><br />This season turned out to be a great season for me despite the rough start.  By mid-January I had far fewer days riding then I had hoped for or expected.  New England wasn’t getting the early season snow it typically does.  But in the end I got 32 days of riding and a few of those days included some of the best riding experiences I have ever had.  Also, I can now say I have snowboarded in May and I snowboarded at least once a month for 7 consecutive months.  Now if I can just get 40+ days next season…</p>

    <p>I received an email today from an individual asking if Excel files could be opened by <a href="http://www.killink.com/">Killink CSV</a>.  The person’s goal is to load the Excel file into <a href="http://www.killink.com/">Killink CSV</a> and save the data to a pipe delimited text file.  As far as I know this cannot be done in Excel, so guess what?</p>

        <a href="/2007/05/01/i-think-delphi-2007-is-great/">I Think Delphi 2007 is Great</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>I received an email today from a person interested in my opinion about Delphi 2007 and CodeGear.  In his email he said he felt the Delphi 2007 release is not going as planned.  He wasn’t sure if that was because the software sucks, support sucks, or what.<br /><br />I know experience and opinions can vary person to person, but I think Delphi 2007 rocks and I feel the CodeGear team is doing an amazing job despite a hiccup here and there.  And to show more love towards CodeGear and Delphi 2007, here is my reply to the person’s email:<br /><br />&lt;div class="quote"&gt;<br />I personally think CodeGear’s Delphi 2007 is one of the best releases of Delphi in years.  I use the product on a daily basis and I have not experienced any major problems.  This latest release makes me excited to use Delphi again.<br /><br />The only serious problem I encountered was the ordering process but the problems were the fault of Digital River, not CodeGear or Delphi 2007.  The CodeGear staff responded quickly to the email I sent informing them of the problems.  Not only that, Loreen Fornshell of CodeGear went above and beyond to assist in correcting the problems caused by Digital River.<br /><br />There is still room for improvement with Delphi.  For example, the help system can use a bit more work.  But this initial offering from the newly formed CodeGear is not only rock solid (in my opinion) but shows that CodeGear is heading in the right direction.<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br /><br />Note: It occurs to me as I type this blog entry that the person might be referring to Delphi for PHP.  I admit I do not share the same love towards Delphi for PHP as I do for Delphi 2007, but it is after all a version 1.0 product.  Visual Studio 2002 and .NET 1.0 wasn’t that great either.</p>

        <a href="/2007/04/29/my-8-week-goals/">My 8 Week Goals</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>I have talked about <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> being a product company for the last couple of years, but the transition from services to products has been challenging.  I’m working on a new email program call Vertigo but progress has been slow for various reasons.  I learned trying to get a product like Vertigo out the door at single person software company is a huge challenge especially when you rely on services work to bootstrap any R&amp;D; work.  <br /><br />What I need is a different approach, so 8 weeks ago I came up with a set of short term goals to start building momentum towards being a product company.  Tomorrow is the last day of the 8 weeks and I’m happy to say I reached my goals as of today.  It hasn’t been easy especially over the last couple of weeks which has had me working 14 hour days, but momentum is finally starting to build.<br /><br />Over the last 8 weeks I released an update to <a href="http://www.smtpdiagnostics.com/">SMTP Diagnostics</a> and published a new product called <a href="http://www.killink.com/">Killink CSV</a>.  I have also made numerous improvements to the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> web sites including a fully integrated <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/buynow.aspx">store front</a>.  More work is needed but things are off to a good start.<br /><br />My next challenge is to sustain and build on top of the momentum started over the past 8 weeks.  This means a new set of goals for the next 8 weeks.  The new goals include:<br /><br />* At least 2 product releases<br />* Sell at least 20 units of my products<br /><br />Key to the next 8 weeks is selling 20 units.  This means not only getting updates to <a href="http://www.killinnk.com/">Killink CSV</a> out the door but making improvements on the marketing side.  Currently, my plans include a press release campaign and Google AdWords.  I also plan to do a better job monitoring conversion rates and web site traffic, something I have ignored over the last year and a half.<br /><br />My motivation level is high and will only get higher as sales increase.  But even with a high level of motivation I must do a better job managing my time during the next 8 weeks.  I’ve been working 14 days recently and it’s starting to wear on me…and on my wife too.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>White Peak Software has a set of support email accounts.  Each time an email is received it is logged to a tracking database and internal notification emails are sent out.  In addition to responding to incoming email I review email messages marked as spam each day.  <br /><br />I noticed today the number of spam messages received had dropped to only 5.  This seemed odd but a new grey listing anti-spam measure was also implemented this week on the mail server.  I thought it was too good to be true that 99% of spam messages received were being filtered by the mail server.  After all the mail server is configured to mark most spams not deleted them for fear of fault positives.<br /><br />As it turns out the reduction in new spam messages was not the result of improved filtering but a problem with the tracking system.  The support mail accounts have been overloaded the last 48 hours and the tracking system has been slow to catch up.  The problem has been fixed and the queued messages are now being processed.  <br /><br />If it had not been for the reduced spam count the problem might have gone undetected for a longer period of time.  For once spam proved to be useful.</p>

    <p>I posted a new version of the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/connectiontool.aspx">Connection Tool for SQL Server</a>.  This free tool provides an easy way to test and build connection strings for SQL Server databases.  This latest version has improved support for Windows 98/ME and Windows Vista.<br /><br />One unfortunate side effect with this release is you must delete the ConnectionToolForSQLServer.exe.config file if you used the previous version.  This file is found in the same directory as the ConnectionToolForSQLServer.exe program file.  If you don’t you will get an error message similar to this:<br /><br />&lt;div class="quote"&gt;<br />ConnectionToolForSQlServer.exe<br /><br />This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br /><br />I explain the reason for this <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/04/25/when_naming_a_configuration_file_programexeconfig_is_bad.aspx">here</a>.</p>
