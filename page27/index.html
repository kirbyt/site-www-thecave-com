        <a href="/2007/03/21/update-on-delphi-2007-order-mess/">Update on Delphi 2007 Order Mess</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>The <a href="http://www.codegear.com/">CodeGear</a> folks are awesome.  They were quick to respond to my <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/19/why_i_will_never_preorder_from_codegear_again.aspx">pre-order issue</a>.  CodeGear’s Loreen Fornshell worked directly with me.  She was able to sort through the mess and correct the mistakes made by Digital River.  It did take a few days but based on my phone calls with Digital River I suspect the delays were caused by DR and not CodeGear.<br /><br />Thanks to CodeGear folks like Loreen my pre-order mess has finally been cleaned up and I should have my license for <a href="http://www.codegear.com/delphi">Delphi 2007</a> later today.  <br /><br />I installed Vista the other day preparing the Delphi 2007.  I don’t have much of an opinion on Vista yet because I haven’t spent much time playing with it other than to say you better have a beefy machine with lots of RAM if you want the best UI experience.  I ordered more RAM for my laptop so I can run Vista’s Aero theme.  I’m not 100% sure if this will meet the minimum requirements needed to use the Aero theme but based on what I have read it should.  I’ll know in a couple of days after the new RAM arrives.</p>

        <a href="/2007/03/19/why-i-will-never-pre-order-from-codegear-again/">Why I will NEVER Pre-order from CodeGear Again</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>Borland announced last year the spin off of CodeGear, their Developer Tools Group.  Since that time CodeGear has done things to improve not only their products but communication with the developer community.  I have been so excited about this new energy that I pre-order a license for Delphi 2007 back in February.<br /><br />Last week CodeGear announced a 25% discount for pre-orders of Delphi 2007.  I had already placed my order so I sent an email to CodeGear asking if it were possible to apply the discount to my current order.  The recommendation from CodeGear was to cancel my original order and place a new one.  And this is where the problems began.<br /><br />CodeGear uses Digital River for their order processing (when purchasing through the Borland Store in the U.S.) and the experience has been awful.  First, I attempted to submit a request to cancel the original order via the Borland Store.  I received no confirmation on the cancellation request even after waiting more than 24 hours.  So I called customer support and spoke with a customer service rep.<br /><br />The customer service rep told me my order could not be cancelled, but long story short she could apply the 25% discount manually to the order.  I thought all was good.<br /><br />Friday at the CodeRage event an announcement was made about the release of Delphi 2007.  Download instructions and license keys were being sent out.  Heck, customers in Germany were able to start downloading Friday afternoon.<br /><br />I waited all weekend for my email.  Unfortunately it never arrived.  And today I received an email from Digital River telling me my order has been cancelled.  Yep, it took almost a week for Digital River to receive the original request sent through the web site.<br /><br />On top of that, the email I received this morning acknowledged the fact that I had spoken with a customer service representative last week.  Yet even though the customer service rep has already worked out the issues with the original order, Digital River still cancelled the order today.  (And yes, I mentioned the cancellation request sent via the web to the customer service rep I spoke with last week and I was told not to worry about it.)<br /><br />So I’ve been on the phone with Digital River (again) and I have spoken with 2 separate customer service reps today.  The story I’m told now is that my order has been cancelled and the only option I have is to replace a new order.  But here’s where it gets crazier.<br /><br />As part of the original order I subscribed to the annual support and maintenance, also known as software assurance.  I was charged for this last month when the original order was placed.  I asked since my order was cancelled and I’m now forced to replace a new order will I need to reorder the software assurance option or will the original request be honored (meaning I will receive future releases free during the term of the subscription).  (Note: The subscription has already been “fulfilled” and cannot be cancelled.)  Digital River has no clue and the order issue is being escalated to someone higher up (this will be the second escalation today).<br /><br />Meanwhile, people who purchased Delphi 2007 on Friday have most likely already received their license key and download instructions.  People in the Delphi newsgroups are already talking about downloading and installing the product.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, placed my order almost 1 month ago and as of right now have no idea when my order will be fulfilled.  I will never again pre-order from CodeGear.<br /><br />CodeGear, I love your products.  I love your team and the new energy coming out of Scotts Valley.  But you need to seriously reevaluate your ordering and fulfillment system and the use of Digital River, which seems to only make matters worse.<br /><br /><b>Update:</b> I received <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/19/developers_do_matter_at_codegear.aspx">responses from CodeGear</a> and the mess will hopefully be cleaned up soon.<br /><br /><b>Update 2:</b> The issues have been <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/21/update_on_delphi_2007_order_mess.aspx">resolved</a>.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Earlier today I made a rant posting about how <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/19/why_i_will_never_preorder_from_codegear_again.aspx">my Delphi 2007 order had been cancelled</a>.  It is my opinion that Digital River is the source of the problem, although some blame has to be put on CodeGear for using Digital River.<br /><br />That said, I am amazed at the response I have received from CodeGear.  I sent an email sharing my story to key individuals at CodeGear.  The purpose of my email was to let them know about the issues I am having and the mess that is getting messier with Digital River.  I wasn’t expecting any action from CodeGear because ultimately the order was messed up by Digital River and their enability to process requests in sequential order.<br /><br />Soon after sending my story to CodeGear I got a couple of email responses including responses from <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/nickhodges/">Nick Hodge</a> and <a href="http://blogs.codegear.com/michaelswindell/">Michael Swindell</a>.  I even received a phone call.  Wow!  Talk about customer service.  This sort of action would never happen if the Developer Tools Group remained as Borland.<br /><br />CodeGear is helping as much as they to resolve this mess, and I for one am very impressed.  Now if only Digital River shared the same passion and devotion this mess would already be cleaned up.<br /><br />It’s cheesy to say, but developers really <b>DO</b> matter at <a href="http://www.codegear.com/">CodeGear</a>.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Day 2 at <a href="http://conferences.codegear.com/coderage07">CodeRage</a> is underway and the technical problems are far fewer than yesterday.  As a matter of fact I have not experienced any technical issues today.  Everything appears to be running fine.<br /><br />Dr Bob’s session <a href="http://video.codegear.com/coderage/ragingconference.exe/convert?track=&amp;page=allsessions.html#REFNO1251">Using AJAX to Extend Delphi Web Applications</a> just ended.  By far the best session so far because I learned a lot in this one session that I can begin using today.  While the focus of the talk was AJAX, Delphi’s WebBroker techology was used.  I have heard of WebBroker but have never used it.  I have to say I was very impressed with this technology gem, and I’m kicking myself for not looking at it sooner.</p>

    <p>The number of spam messages received through blog comments at thecave.com has increased to a point where I finally had to do something about it.  So today I implemented a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA</a> field required to make a blog comment.  The code is a partial C# port of the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/CaptchaControl.asp">CAPTCHA Server Control for ASP.NET</a>, which is written in VB.NET.<br /><br />My next step will be removing the 400+ spam comments posted.  Joy, joy.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> The CAPTCHA implementation has eliminated 100% of blog comment spam on this site.  I wish email spam could be eliminated just as easily.</p>
