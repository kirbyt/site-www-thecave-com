        <a href="/2007/04/10/csv-editing/">CSV Editing</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>CSV (also known as comma separated values, comma separated list, or comma separated variable) is a commonly used file format that stores tabular data.  Each data element, or value, is separated with a comma or other single character delimiter such as a Tab character.  These types of files are also called delimited text files or flat files.<br /><br />Many software application support CSV delimited text files either as an import or export data format.  For example, Outlook users can export the address book to a comma separated value file and import the contacts into another application.<br /><br />I have worked with comma and tab delimited text files throughout most of my career.  I have written applications that produce delimited text and consume delimited text.  And while XML is my preferred file format for sharing data there is no escaping the usefulness of CSV delimited text files.<br /><br />While CSV delimited text files are typically used to import and export data between software applications there are times when individuals must <a href="http://www.killink.com/">manually create or edit comma and tab delimited text files</a>.  And many of these individuals use a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.  However, using a full featured spreadsheet such as Excel to create and edit CSV delimited text files seems overkill to me.<br /><br />For starters, say you only need to <a href="http://www.killink.com/">manipulate CSV delimited text</a> files and have no need for working with spreadsheets.  The licensing cost of Excel is hardly justified.  Secondly Excel imposes certain size limitations.  Excel is limited to 65,536 rows of data and 256 columns per worksheet.  This means you will not be able to open a delimited text file containing 100,000 rows.  Faced with high licensing cost, overkill list of features, and size limitations I decided to write Killink.  <br /><br /><a href="http://www.killink.com/">Killink</a> is a spreadsheet-like editor for delimited text files.  It supports delimited text files using any single character delimiter including comma and tab, and it supports large delimited text files.<br /><br />Version 1.0 is currently in beta test which is open to the public.  Visit the <a href="http://www.killink.com/download.aspx">Killink download page</a> and give the latest release a test drive.  I appreciate any feedback, good or bad, you might have about Killink.  Feedback can be posted to the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/">Killink Support forum</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update</span>: Microsoft has improved the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/excel/archive/2005/09/26/474258.aspx">limitation of Excel</a>.  Excel 2007 supports 1 million rows per worksheet.</p>

    <p>I’m adding a new feature to <a href="http://www.killink.com/">Killink</a> to allow the user to integrate the application with Windows Explorer.  Not a difficult task.  Just involves making some registry settings.  But one registry setting I need to make must go under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and this hive is under administrative control in Vista.  <br /><br />This isn’t such a big deal if I am using an installer.  Installers will typically ask for elevated permissions to perform the install.  But I’m trying to provide a version that does not require an installer.  This means my application will have to ask for elevated permissions when the user clicks the option to integrate with Explorer.  It also means I need to display the shield icon indicating that elevated permissions are required to perform the task.<br /><br />This really has me bummed out because it means more work (and learning).  Now I have to learn up to ask for elevated permissions within the application.<br /><br />Sigh…</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>The 7th thing I like about Delphi 2007 is the “non-breaking” release.  In a nutshell this means DCU and packages compiled for BDS 2006 will work with Delphi 2007.  I initially had problems with some of the 3rd party packages I manually installed in Delphi 2007 so I didn’t list this as one of the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/25/5_things_i_like_about_delphi_2007.aspx">5 things I like about Delphi 2007</a>.  But after resolving the issues (caused by me) I’m finding NO problems using 3rd party packages built for BDS 2006 in Delphi 2007.<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/25/5_things_i_like_about_delphi_2007.aspx">Things I Like About Delphi 2007 #1-5</a>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/26/things_i_like_about_delphi_2007_6.aspx">Things I Like About Delphi 2007 #6</a>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

    <p>The number 6 thing I like about <a href="http://www.codegear.com/delphi">Delphi 2007</a> is the new message output for compiles.  It provides detailed information about the compile including the dcc32.exe command line.  It’s nice to see this level of detail especially when odd things start to happen.</p>

    <p>In my posting <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/25/5_things_i_like_about_delphi_2007.aspx">5 Things I Like About Delphi 2007</a> I mentioned debugging problems I experienced after installing 3rd party packages.  The source of the problem was in fact the use of certain 3rd party packages, more specifically the DevExpress VCL packages.  However the problem wasn’t with the DevExpress directly.  <br /><br />I installed all packages found in the DevExpress library/delphi10 directory.  This was a mistake made by me.  Only certain design time packages need to be installed in the IDE, not all packages in that directory.  Lucky for me I still have BDS 2006 installed.<br /><br />I launch BDS 2006 and Delphi 2007.  I went to the installed package list in BDS 2006 (Component &gt; Install Packages…) and manually added each DevExpress package listed in BDS 2006 to Delphi 2007.  This resolved the debugging issues I experienced yesterday.  And now I’m able to make use of Delphi 2007 for existing projects.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Bloggers in the Delphi community have been tagging each other to post 5 things they like about the Delphi 2007.  I wasn’t tagged but I want to play so here are my 5 things.<br /><br />1) <b>Speed</b> - The IDE loads and shutdowns so much faster then BDS 2006.  There seems to be other performance enhancements too such as switching between the form designer and code window.  The IDE is so much faster that I don’t like going back to BDS 2006.<br /><br />2) <b>Vista Support</b> - This is a wonderful enhancement.  I especially like how existing projects using dialogs and routines such as MessageDlg automatically have a Vista look simply by re-compiling the project.<br /><br />3) <b>Application.MainFormOnTaskbar</b> - I really like this new property.  I’m working on an SDI application that manages windows in a similar way as Microsoft Word and Outlook.  Overriding CreateParams and setting the ExStyle isn’t a big deal but having the MainFormOnTaskbar property helps to reduce some code.  <br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> Steve Trefethen posted a nice overview of <a href="http://www.stevetrefethen.com/blog/TheNewVCLPropertyTApplicationMainFormOnTaskbarInDelphi2007.aspx">Application.MainFormOnTaskbar</a>.<br /><br />4) <b>Online Help</b> - I like the new look of the help system and the new navigation between pages is really nice.  But I do have one major complaint.  Help indexes found in the BDS 2006 help system are missing.  For example launch the help system, go to Index, and enter “CreateDir routine” in the “Look for” textbox.  The routine is not indexed in the new help system but it is indexed in the previous help system.  And this is not the only routine not indexed.  It sucks that this sort of information is no longer indexed in the help system.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span>Delphi 2007 Update 1 fixes my complaint about the online help.  Routines such as CreateDir are now indexed.<br /><br />5) <b>Improved Tool Palette Search</b> - I really like how the tool palette search has been improved to find all matches containing the search word, not just matches beginning with the search word.  This is a great improvement for me given that I use a number of 3rd party VCL components that are prefixed (i.e., TcxComboBox). <br /><br />So that’s my list of 5 things I like about Delphi 2007.  But what about the things I do not like about Delphi 2007.<br /><br />1) “Non-breaking” Release - Well, sort of.  The idea is that DCUs and packages from BDS 2006 can be used in Delphi 2007.  In general this is true.  However, I have encountered a number of problems.  For starters Delphi 2007 is having trouble loading certain DevExpress packages at startup.  And I have read in the newsgroups there is a painting issue too although I have not personally experienced it.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> Turns out the problem was me.  I was installing DevExpress packages that weren’t meant for the IDE.  After installing the correct set of DevExpress VCL packages my IDE problems went away.<br /><br />2) Trouble Debugging - This problem has me scratching my head and for the life of me I cannot figure it out.  All BDS 2006 projects I have opened in Delphi 2007 will not run under the interactive debugger.  I haven’t logged this issue in QC yet because I’m still trying to figure out what is happening.  Simply saying “Cannot debug project opened from BDS 2006 project file” does not give CodeGear enough information to troubleshoot the problem.  But the problem still remains.  I cannot debug existing projects.  (Note: I suspect this issue might have something to do with the 3rd party packages such as the ones I’m using from DevExpress.)<br /><br />3) More Issues with Debugging - From time to time I get a weird error message when I press F9.  The message says the debugger cannot create the process.  I launch Sysinternal’s Process Explorer and notice the application to debug is running under the bds.exe process and yet the debugger cannot attach to it.  To make matter worse I cannot kill the spawned process.  I have to close down the IDE to kill it. (Again, I suspect this issue might have somethign to do with some of the 3rd party packages I have manually installed.)<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/26/fixed_my_delphi_2007_debug_issues.aspx">Fixed my Delphi 2007 debug issues</a>.<br /><br />4) No Support in FinalBuilder (yet) - I use FinalBuilder for all my projects and unfortunately FinalBuilder does not support Delphi 2007 (yet).  But according to the newsgroups a new compiler action for Delphi 2007 is in the works.  <br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> FinalBuilder now has a Delphi 2007 compiler action.<br /><br />5) No Support in EurekaLog (yet) - EurekaLog is another 3rd party tool I use, and unfortunately support for Delphi 2007 is not there yet.  But good news is EurekaLog should have support in about 2 weeks.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> EurekaLog now has Delphi 2007.<br /><br />I know some of these dislikes are not directly Delphi 2007 but they do prevent me from completely moving from BDS 2006 to Delphi 2007 right now.  So Delphi 2007 is still an experiment for me at the moment while I wait for 3rd party support.  Meanwhile I’m still using BDS 2006 for production work.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> I now use Delphi 2007 daily.  Best Delphi IDE in a long time.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>The <a href="http://www.codegear.com/">CodeGear</a> folks are awesome.  They were quick to respond to my <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/19/why_i_will_never_preorder_from_codegear_again.aspx">pre-order issue</a>.  CodeGear’s Loreen Fornshell worked directly with me.  She was able to sort through the mess and correct the mistakes made by Digital River.  It did take a few days but based on my phone calls with Digital River I suspect the delays were caused by DR and not CodeGear.<br /><br />Thanks to CodeGear folks like Loreen my pre-order mess has finally been cleaned up and I should have my license for <a href="http://www.codegear.com/delphi">Delphi 2007</a> later today.  <br /><br />I installed Vista the other day preparing the Delphi 2007.  I don’t have much of an opinion on Vista yet because I haven’t spent much time playing with it other than to say you better have a beefy machine with lots of RAM if you want the best UI experience.  I ordered more RAM for my laptop so I can run Vista’s Aero theme.  I’m not 100% sure if this will meet the minimum requirements needed to use the Aero theme but based on what I have read it should.  I’ll know in a couple of days after the new RAM arrives.</p>
