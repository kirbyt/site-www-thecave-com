        <a href="/2005/11/22/let-down-twice-today-by-microsoft/">Let down twice today by Microsoft</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>This is more of a rant then anything else but I gotta say it.  I’m really disappointed with Microsoft today.  It started at the NYC Product Launch event for Visual Studio 2005, SQL Server 2005 and BizTalk 2006.  <br /><br />Today’s event was a let down for me.  I have been to many similar Microsoft events over the years and have always left thinking “This was well worth my time.”  Today’s event was only worth my time because of the free giveaways.  The actual event itself was a let down and left me wondering if Visual Studio Team Services is really ready.<br /><br />For starters the demo of VSTS used a pre-RTM version.  This was a launch day event and pre-released software was demoed…WTF!  On top of that many of the features demoed did not work, presumably because the pre-RTM release was used.  Unit tests did not run, web tests did not run, load tests did not run, reports could not be displayed, and in certain cases bad practices were demoed such as saving the list of work items in SharePoint as an Excel spreadsheet.  I would not want my team working from a static list of work items when Foundation Server is installed and live information can be used.<br /><br />Disappointed with the event I decided to return to the office early to get some work done.  My plan for the rest of the day is to evaluate the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlbulkcopy.aspx">SqlBulkCopy class</a> for a customer.  I wanted to quickly see the class definition for SqlBulkCopy so I went to load <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq/archive/2004/10/20/245236.aspx">wincv.exe</a>.  <br /><br />For those of you who don’t know what wincv.exe is, it is a class viewer for the .NET Framework classes.  I often use it to identify property and methods names, which is faster using wincv.exe then the MSDN documentation.  But to my surprise wincv.exe is NOT included with the .NET Framework 2.0 SDK.  What gives?  I found it to be a very useful tool that I used on a regular basis.  Now it is gone.  Even the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sbey26hw.aspx">wincv.exe page</a> says it ships only with version 1.0 and 1.1 of the .NET Framework.  <br /><br />I have been using this tool for 4 years and I’m disappointed that I cannot continue using it with the new release of the framework.  Needless to say this adds to my disappointment in Microsoft today.  If only my Xbox 360 had arrived today.  Things might seem different.</p>

    <p>Recently I mentioned the RSS feed for this site had a bug in it.  The link for each blog item was incorrect.  The reason this happened is because I was using Blogger.com to generate the rss.xml file and Blogger had no way of knowing the link used on the site.  I finally fixed this today but it means Blogger is no longer generating the XML file.  It also means the URL to the RSS feed has changed.<br /><br />If you are reading this blog from an RSS-based aggregator you will need to update the URL for the feed.  The new URL is:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thecave.com/rss.aspx">http://www.thecave.com/rss.aspx</a></p>

        <a href="/2005/11/09/my-opinion-of-typed-data-sets-is-changing/">My Opinion of Typed Data Sets is Changing</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>Is there a place in the .NET development world for typed data sets?  I use to think resounding “No”.  I despised typed data sets ever since I was first exposed to them in a VB.NET training class back in 2001.  Actually, until last week I have not even looked at typed data sets since that class.  <br /><br />I love writing code so custom business entity and handed-rolled CRUD classes are a-okay with me.  But I’m starting to develop a change in opinion about typed data sets in .NET.  It all began last week when I started evaluation ADO.NET 2.0.<br /><br />First of all, loading data into a DataSet or DataTable is much faster in ADO.NET 2.0, night and day faster.  For instance, I ran a speed test that loads 1 million rows into a DataTable.  The test took just over 52 minutes to load the 1 million rows using ADO.NET 1.1.  The same test took only 27.36 seconds using ADO.NET 2.0.  Now that’s a performance improvement.  If you previously discard DataSet and DataTable because of performance reasons, you owe it to yourself to take another look at them in ADO.NET 2.0.<br /><br />A typed data set is nothing more than code generated by Visual Studio that inherits from the DataSet and DataTable classes, among others.  You can view a typed data set as nothing more than a set of generated business entity and CRUD classes.  Because typed data sets inherit from DataSet and DataTable, they share the same performance boost given to its parent classes.  But this alone did not convince me that typed data sets finally have a place in the development world.<br /><br />Visual Studio.NET 2005 really impressed me on how easy it is to now create a typed data set.  The wizards make it easy to associate your CRUD stored procedures to the table adapter, and you can just as easily extended the functionality to include adhoc queries and other non-CRUD stored procedures.  And Visual Studio will generate over 800 lines of code that handles concurrency checking and other ADO.NET best practices with a simple drag and drop action.  As much as I hate to say it, this is faster than writing your own business entity and CRUD classes.<br /><br />The invention of a type data set is about improving a programmer’s productivity and Visual Studio 2005’s implementation of typed data sets does just that.  It is one of the most productive ways I have seen to build data access and entity classes.  I will definitely consider using typed data sets in future .NET 2.0 work.</p>

        <a href="/2005/10/24/do-we-need-local-email-software/">Do we need local email software?</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>A few months back I mentioned that White Peak Software is working on a new product to be released next year.  That product, code name Vertigo, is a new type of email client for the PC.  The current plan includes 3 editions to Vertigo: Basic, Personal, and Business editions.  The Basic edition is a simple to use email client but the Personal and Business editions will go beyond what other email clients such as Outlook offer.<br /><br />I have shared my vision of improved communication software with many people over the 6 to 12 months.  A common response I get from some is “Why write a PC version of an email client?”  This response typically comes from consumers who use online email such as Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo for personal emails.  My response is always the same, “Not everyone wants to or can work with email while connected.”<br /><br />For lots of users there are times when a person needs to catch up on emails while traveling on a plane or train.  Or maybe that person is staying at a hotel in another country that does not offer a broadband Internet access or all you have is dial-up access to the Internet.  And there are still others who want to do more with their email data such as track statistics, generate reports, and integrate/share the data with other locally run application.<br /><br />I’m not the only one who believes there is a need for local email.  As <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-3000_7-6361432-1.html?tag=nl.e501">Rafe Needleman</a> put it:<br /><br />&lt;div class="quote"&gt;<br />“People who need to work when they are disconnected–and that’s most of us–need a PC with an e-mail application, a modicum of processing power, and local storage. For us, online e-mail applications–be they consumer e-mail like Yahoo or Microsoft’s corporate solution, Outlook Web Access–are useful adjuncts to local e-mail applications. They are not a replacement.”<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br /><br />Will this ever change?  I believe this will change within my lifetime but I don’t see it happening before 2010 or 2012 at the earliest.  It requires that we are always connected to the Internet, which is not the case for so many people today.  Or it might require a new way of integrating local programs with web-base application.  It’s hard to time what the right answer will be, and how or if the browser will become the platform.  I do know, however, that there is a need for local email programs like Vertigo and this need will continue for years to come.</p>
