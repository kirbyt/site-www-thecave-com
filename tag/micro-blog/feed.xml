    <description><![CDATA[<p>I discovered you can see the list of people a person follows on <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, including yourself. It seems the feature is only available in the <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2017/mac-version/">Micro.blog for Mac</a> app. Using it, click a person’s avatar. Under the bio section, you’ll see “Following n” where n is the number of people that the person follows. Click it to see the list of people. Thanks, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>, for giving us another way to discover people on Micro.blog.</p>
