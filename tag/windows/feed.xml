    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I did something that I’ve been saying I will do for a long time. I retired my CSV editor, <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2015/08/18/killinks-retirement/">Killink</a>.</p>

<p>The first release of Killink CSV Editor was back on March 22, 2007, and over the years it has done well despite the fact that I haven’t been actively working on the app or marketing it. Killink had great potential, especially if I had followed the business advice from those smarter than me to focus on the enterprise, but I honestly lost interest in the editor after I started writing apps for Mac and iOS.</p>

<p>I did start work on a Mac version of Killink CSV Editor, and I have still have a semi-working version of it on my iPhone. But I struggled to create the user experience that I wanted on those two platforms. Given enough time I could have conquered the UX challenges, but I knew the market for the editor was small and spending the extra time to do what I wanted didn’t make good business sense. So the Mac and iOS versions never shipped.</p>

<p>I always found the customers of Killink CSV Editor fascinating. While we developer types view CSV as antiquated technology, these customers work with CSV files regularly. And most are business users from large, well known companies. We developer types often times forget that people around the world are using old technologies like CSV daily to do their job, and they too would like a better way to work with old tech like CSV files. Killink CSV Editor was a better way for many for a number of years.</p>

<p>It saddens me to retire Killink CSV Editor, but at the same time I feel like a burden has been lifted off my shoulders. The app is rock solid and support is minimum, but I have felt guilty for a long time about selling a software product that I know isn’t actively being worked on. And with the recent Windows 10 release, I finally decided now is the time to retire my CSV editor.</p>

<p>I’ve heard many good things about Windows 10. But if I keep selling Killink to Windows users I will have no choice but to install it some day. And honestly, I don’t want to do that. I have zero interest in Windows these days.</p>

<p>I do plan to continuing supporting licensed users of Killink CSV Editor, which I talk about over at the <a href="http://blog.whitepeaksoftware.com/2015/08/18/killinks-retirement/">company blog site</a>. The support load is minimum, so providing ongoing support isn’t a concern for me. Killink is a native Win32 app built using Delphi. It’s rock solid and hasn’t had a serious issue that I couldn’t resolve in email in years. So I’m happy to continue answering questions about Killink and helping folks if they happen to run into a problem. That said, I’m not looking forward to the emails I’m going to receive when people try to buy a new license.</p>

<p>When I retired SMTP Diagnostics, another Windows app I sold for years, I received emails for nearly a year asking why it was no longer available and why I couldn’t make an exception this one time and sell a new license. Most of the time the people understood, but a few sent angry emails. I fully expect the same will happen with the retirement of Killink, and all I can say to those folks is sorry.</p>

<p>Retiring my CSV editor ends another chapter in my long software career. I’m a bit sad by this, but I’m also excited by no longer having the mental burden that came with having my editor sit untouched for such a long time while people were still buying licenses for it.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I love my MacBook Pro.  It’s an awesome machine and OS X is a great operating system.  However, I have encountered 2 problems when dealing with my Windows-base network.  First problem is accessing Windows 2003 file shares and the other problem is resolving machine names on the local network.  <br /><br />I still haven’t solved the second problem but today I came across the solution for the first.  This blog posting by Drew McLellan gives the step by step instructions for <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/218/accessing-a-windows-2003-share-from-os-x">accessing Windows 2003 file shares from Mac OS X</a>.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>After resolving the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/07/29/how_to_access_a_windows_2003_file_share_from_mac_os_x.aspx">Windows Server 2003 file share access</a> problem I turned my attention to fixing the DNS issue I’m having.  I’m able to ping the IP address of machines on my Local Area Network but I’m not able to resolve the machine names.  I have a local DNS running on Windows Server 2003 but for some odd reason OS X is not using it to resolve names.  So I decided to use a stop-gap approach for the time being.<br /><br />I modified the /etc/hosts file to include the address of the machines with a static IP address.  After all, these are the only machines I need access to from OS X.  Here are the steps I followed:&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Sign in as an administrator (or an account belonging to the sudousers group)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Launch a terminal shell (Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal if you are using Finder or type <b>terminal</b> in Spotlight)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Run the command <b>sudo vi /etc/hosts</b>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Scroll to the end of the file&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Type <b>i</b> to enter insert mode&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Press the enter key to start a new line (my vi skills are weak as it has been years since I have used it - there is probably a better way to append to the end of a file)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Enter the IP address, press the <b>tab</b> key, then enter the name machine&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Press the <b>esc</b> key to get out of insert mode&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Press <b>:wq</b> to save the changes and quit vi&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;That’s is.  The machine name will now resolve to the IP.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I learned a valuable lesson today about naming configuration files for my programs.  When I started building.NET applications I followed the .NET convention for naming program configuration files:  MyProgram.exe.config<br /><br />These days I write less .NET applications and more native Windows applications using <a href="http://www.codegear.com/delphi">Delphi</a>.  I continue using the .NET naming convention for configuration files for all my programs even native Windows applications.  This hasn’t been a problem until today.<br /><br />Today I embedded a manifest into a program and when I ran the program I got the following error message:<br /><br />&lt;div class="quote"&gt;<br />C:\MyProgram.exe<br /><br />This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect.  Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br /><br />Without the manifest the program ran fine, but the program failed each time the manifest was included.  I first thought a problem was with the manifest.  I review the manifest over, and over, and over again.  I even used a manifest from another application that does not have the problem.  After banging my head on the wall for a couple of hours I found the source of the problem, and it wasn’t the manifest at all.<br /><br />Like all my programs, this particular program creates a configuration file using the .NET naming convention MyProgram.exe.config.  But in this one case the configuration file is stored in the same directory as the program file, and here in lies the problem.<br /><br />Apparently Windows XP, and I assume Vista as well, expects the program configuration file to be based on some specific config file schema when the manifest is embedded in the program file even if the program is a native Windows program.  I knew this to be true with .NET applications but I didn’t realize the same is true for native Windows applications.<br /><br />I have not spent time figuring out the expected schema.  I suspect it is the .NET config file schema, but I now follow a new naming convention.  I do not name my config files MyProgram.exe.config any more.  Instead I use MyProgram.config, which does not have any negative side effects when stored in the same directory as the program file.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> If you want to use the .NET config file naming convention for your native Windows application, your .config file must be an XML, and the root element must be .  Other root elements might be allowed but I know  works.</p>
