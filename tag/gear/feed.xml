    <description><![CDATA[<p>I returned from my second trip using the GR1, and I can now say the <a href="https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3">Goruck GR1</a> is now my favorite everyday backpack. My latest trip was to WWDC, and the GR1 kicked ass. I packed everything I needed for the week in the ruck, and I used it as my daypack each day at the conference. I especially like how slim the bag is even when stuffed full. I had no problems sliding it in and out from under the seat on the plane. And the zippers are quiet enough when opening and closing as to not disturb those sitting around me at the conference during talks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I returned from my second trip using the GR1, and I can now say the <a href="https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3">Goruck GR1</a> is now my favorite everyday backpack. My latest trip was to WWDC, and the GR1 kicked ass. I packed everything I needed for the week in the ruck, and I used it as my daypack each day at the conference. I especially like how slim the bag is even when stuffed full. I had no problems sliding it in and out from under the seat on the plane. And the zippers are quiet enough when opening and closing as to not disturb those sitting around me at the conference during talks.</p>

<p>Here was my packing list for the conference:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 T-shirts</li>
<li>A pair of flip-flops.</li>
<li>A paid of Five Finger shoes.</li>
<li>A rain jacket.</li>
<li>A pack towel (don't forget your towel)</li>
<li>A pair of jeans.</li>
<li>Boxes and extra socks (for the sneakers I worn to and from SF)</li>
<li>15" MacBook Pro (circa 2007, not one of those uber cool new ones)</li>
<li>Power supply and extended power cord for the MBP</li>
<li>Ethernet cable</li>
<li>iPad</li>
<li>Headphones</li>
<li>Charging cables, styluses, Square</li>
<li>Tooth brush, toothpaste, deodorant, soap</li>
<li>Beard trimmer and beard comb</li>
<li>Buttons and pins for lanyard flare</li>
<li>Extra field guide</li>
<li>A buff</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I attached a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086UBPDM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0086UBPDM">Condor H2O pouch</a> to my GR1 to carry my water bottle on the plane ride. And I put the stuff in my pockets (wallet, iPhone, field notes, pen, pocket flashlight, and Fitbit) into the pouch when going through TSA security. I love that I can expand my GR1 as needed like this using the molle webbing. I took the H2O pouch off during the week while attending the conference since my water bottle fit fine in the bag.</p>

<p>The only issue I had was returning home with extra shirts and the WWDC jacket. I didn’t have the needed space for the extra stuff, so the WWDC jacket and a couple of pairs of boxers went into a sack that I carried. Next year I’ll remember to leave room for swag on the return trip.</p>

<p>My first trip with the GR1 was to Arkansas with my son to go car camping with my dad, brother, and his son. While the GR1 performed well on this trip, it wasn’t a good test for me since I was not traveling light on that trip. Most of the gear was checked for the plane ride since it was camping gear. Still, the pack served me well on that trip.</p>

My <a href="https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3">Goruck GR1 backpack</a> arrived today, and so far I’m very impressed with it. The construction of this bag is top notch, and the bag screams quality. I love the minimalistic look and it’s low profile. It is a little stiff coming right out of the box, but it’s already loosening up after packing and unpacking it a few times and wearing it around the house.</p>

My <a href="https://www.goruckgear.com/Gear/Details/3">Goruck GR1 backpack</a> arrived today, and so far I’m very impressed with it. The construction of this bag is top notch, and the bag screams quality. I love the minimalistic look and it’s low profile. It is a little stiff coming right out of the box, but it’s already loosening up after packing and unpacking it a few times and wearing it around the house.</p>

<p>I did a test run packing the GR1, loading it with the clothes (jeans, t-shirts, boxers, socks, rain jacket) and gear (iPad, MacBook Pro 15”, cables, Bose headphones) I plan to take to San Francisco in a couple of weeks. The GR1 had plenty of space for my stuff with room to spare. The true test, of course, comes this weekend when I take it on a camping trip with Rowan.</p>

<p>I have high hopes for this bag. It will be my go to bag for most things I do, from being my main laptop bag to being the bag I take on short trips (7 days or less - I pack light). There is, however, one change I would make to the GR1.</p>

<p>The front, outside pocket is deep enough to hold my iPad, which makes it great especially for air travel. However, the pocket could be about a half inch deeper. There’s room on the bag to make this happen.</p>

<p>Other than this one change, the bag appears to suit my needs perfectly, and I’m very excited to put it to the test this summer.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m not sure I would <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/the-cave-tent/">buy this tent</a>, but I do like the name. An inflatable tent does sound interesting, but at 11.5 pounds plus a hand pump, I’m not sure it’s for me. Then again, my current “big” tent does take 5 to 10 minutes to setup and teardown.</p>
