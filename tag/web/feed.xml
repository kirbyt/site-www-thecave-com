    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been doing a bit of tinkering here at thecave. I realized I was using categories as if they were tags and for one simple reason. I didn’t have a way to support tags. That is, until now.</p>

<p>Tag support is provided in Jekyll, but I wanted something slightly different. I want the list of tags to appear at the end of a post just like the categories have for last couple of years. I searched for different ways to support tags with Jekyll, but I didn’t find anything suiting my needs. Then it occurred to me I could tweak the category plugins I use to work with tags, so that’s exactly what I did.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/recurser/jekyll-plugins">Jekyll category plugins</a> I use come from Dave Perretter. I made copies of <em>category_generator.rb</em> and <em>category_list_tags.rb</em> naming the new plugins <em>tag_generator.rb</em> and <em>tag_list_tags.rb</em>. Then I replace references to <code class="highlighter-rouge">categories</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">category</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">tags</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">tag</code> in the source code. And BAM! I now have tag support at thecave.com.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for the plugins in my site’s github <a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com/tree/master/_plugins">repo</a>.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m preparing to roll out a new <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> website, but unlike with my other Jekyll sites, I want each web page served up on <code class="highlighter-rouge">https</code>, not <code class="highlighter-rouge">http</code>. This means telling the server to redirect <code class="highlighter-rouge">http</code> request to <code class="highlighter-rouge">https</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m preparing to roll out a new <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> website, but unlike with my other Jekyll sites, I want each web page served up on <code class="highlighter-rouge">https</code>, not <code class="highlighter-rouge">http</code>. This means telling the server to redirect <code class="highlighter-rouge">http</code> request to <code class="highlighter-rouge">https</code>.</p>

<p>Hosting this new site on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> isn’t option because Github Pages doesn’t support using a custom SSL certificate for your custom domain name. So I decided to see what it would take to host a Jekyll site on <a href="https://www.openshift.com">OpenShift</a>.</p>

<p>I was thrilled to learn that OpenShift has a <a href="https://hub.openshift.com/quickstarts/41-jekyll">quick start cartridge for installing Jekyll</a> on a new gear. With a click of a button I was able to deploy my new server instance with a boiler plate Jekyll site. I replaced the boiler plate site with the one I’ve been working on, and BAM! My site was up and running. The only step remaining was to force the web server to serve up the pages using <code class="highlighter-rouge">https</code>.</p>

<p>Turns out this is simple to do with OpenShift and Jekyll. First, I went over to namecheap.com and purchased a <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/rapidssl/rapidssl.aspx">RapidSSL certificate</a> with domain validation. Next, I followed the instructions from OpenShift to <a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-domains-ssl.html#_generating_a_csr_certificate_signing_request">generate my certificate signing request</a>. Using my newly generated CSR I activated my RapidSSL certificate over at namecheap, then I followed the instructions on OpenShift to <a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-domains-ssl.html#using-a-custom-ssl-certificate">add the certificate to my server instance</a>.</p>

<p>Up to this point everything was easy peasy, and all I had left to do was figure out how to redirect the Jekyll site from <code class="highlighter-rouge">http</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">https</code>. Turns out this isn’t difficult either.</p>

<p>The Jekyll website is actually just a static website hosted by Apache 2 running on an OpenShift gear. To force the redirect all I needed to do was add a <em>.htaccess</em> file to the root of my Jekyll site source code (note: the site source code is in the <em>source/</em> directory when using OpenShift) and put this rewrite rule in the file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>RewriteEngine on  
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https  
RewriteRule .* https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R,L]  
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After I added the <em>.htaccess</em> file with the rewrite rule, I pushed my changes to the remote git repository running on my OpenShift gear. This launched Jekyll which re-built my static website, this time with each web page being served with <code class="highlighter-rouge">https</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">http</code>.</p>

<p>Including the <em>.htaccess</em> file works great when deploying the Jekyll site to OpenShift, but approach isn’t unique to OpenShift. This should work for most Jekyll site hosted with Apache 2. And if for some reason Jekyll isn’t including the <em>.htaccess</em> file when it builds the site, add <code class="highlighter-rouge">include: [".htaccess"]</code> to your <em>_config.yaml</em> file.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been on a website redesign kick lately updating sites such as <a href="http://www.kirbyturner.com">kirbyturner.com</a> and <a href="http://www.rowanturner.net">rowanturner.net</a>. The recent update to my <a href="http://www.kirbyturner.com">vanity website</a> gives it a more modern look, and <a href="http://www.rowanturner.net">Rowan’s website</a> now has a clean, fresh look that focuses on the content.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been on a website redesign kick lately updating sites such as <a href="http://www.kirbyturner.com">kirbyturner.com</a> and <a href="http://www.rowanturner.net">rowanturner.net</a>. The recent update to my <a href="http://www.kirbyturner.com">vanity website</a> gives it a more modern look, and <a href="http://www.rowanturner.net">Rowan’s website</a> now has a clean, fresh look that focuses on the content.</p>

<p>I especially like Rowan’s new site design. It uses a responsive design site theme so it looks good on the desktop as well as on mobile devices. I also like how it has custom header images for posts, and the clean and simply layout for posts makes it easy to focus on the content in each post. I like the site design for Rowan’s website so much that I decided to use the same site theme here at thecave.</p>

<p>I couldn’t, however, use the site theme as is. thecave is a bit more involved given that it uses categories. Plus, I want to provide a complete <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive.html">archive</a> of every post available. These are things not found on Rowan’s site, so I’ve spent the last couple of evenings tweaking the site theme to be more appropriate for thecave.com.</p>

<p>Other changes I made include adding a footer to each page that shows recent articles and a link list to other sites that I run, and adding an <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive.html">archive</a> link to the top that gives you access to every post made here since 2002. There is also a <a href="http://www.thecave.com/categories.html">categories</a> link in the top bar for those who would rather find an article based on a category. But the change that I like the most is the rotating header images for each post.</p>

<p>The original site theme lets me pick a header image for a new post, and if I do not specify a header image then the default header image is used. This works but it felt a bit boring to me. I want to see other header images when reading through old posts, not the same one over and over. So I tweaked the theme to pick the header image, when not specified, by performing a modulus operation on the day of the month. It’s not random, but it’s also not boring. Now as you page through posts you will see different header images<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I have more work I want to do to this site such as adding an RSS feed for each category. Actually the site has had a feed file for each category for years. I just haven’t made the URL to the category feed files obvious. But that should be easier to do now that there is a page dedicated to listing all the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/categories.html">categories</a>.</p>

<p>So there you have it…the new site theme for thecave.com. Let me know what you think<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I made the same change to the theme on Rowan’s website. Now you can see more fun pictures of Rowan as you read through the posts.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>You will find links to me on various social networks such as App.net and Twitter below in the page footer.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I bought a new Burton snowboard the other day. I ordered it online from a mom and pop shop in the Oregon. I wanted to buy locally here in Stowe but the price I paid was 10% cheaper than the price listed on the websites of local shops. Combined with the fact that I didn’t have to pay sales tax and shipping was free, I felt I was getting a great deal. Still, I would have preferred to support a local shop here in Vermont, but at least I supported a local shop in Oregon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bought a new Burton snowboard the other day. I ordered it online from a mom and pop shop in the Oregon. I wanted to buy locally here in Stowe but the price I paid was 10% cheaper than the price listed on the websites of local shops. Combined with the fact that I didn’t have to pay sales tax and shipping was free, I felt I was getting a great deal. Still, I would have preferred to support a local shop here in Vermont, but at least I supported a local shop in Oregon.</p>

<p>All good, right? Well…</p>

<p>My wife stopped by one of the local Stowe shops today to buy a pair of new skis. Turns out the shop has a sale going on…20% off all Burton boards! Turns out if I had bought my new board locally I would have saved more money than buying online. Plus I would have my board now instead of waiting until next week.</p>

<p>So why didn’t I buy locally given that the sale is going on? It’s because I didn’t know about the sale. Being the type of person I am, I check online before going into brick and mortar stores, and I checked the websites of the local Stowe shops before looking elsewhere. But the shop having the awesome sale did not advise the sale on their website. And because they didn’t advise the sale I ended up taking my business elsewhere.</p>

<p>What could this store have done to win my business? They could have shown the sale price on their website. And if they didn’t want to offer the sale price for online orders, then they could have advised the sale on the front page of their website. Something as simple as “20% Off All Snowboards” for in-store purchases only would have brought me into the store two days ago. And since they have the snowboard I want in stock, it would have been an easy sell. I would have been in and out of the store in under 10 minutes, and they would have a few hundred more dollars in the cash register.</p>

<p>Still, I’m happy with my purchase. With my online purchase I was able to support a locally owned, small business…granted in Oregon instead of Vermont, but that’s still better than buying from a big corporate retail chain. And while I spent more money with my online order, it was only $32 more than I would have paid locally when you add sales tax. So I didn’t lose out too much. The Stowe shop, and the state of Vermont for that matter, lost out more than I did and all because the shop didn’t update their website.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I have owned the vanity domain name <a href="http://www.kirbyturner.com">kirbyturner.com</a> for a long time, but I didn’t anything with it after buying it. That changed back when I was writing <a href="http://www.learningipadprogramming.com">Learning iPad Programming</a>. My publisher asked that I setup a website that talks about me, so I finally put kirbyturner.com to use. Unfortunately I never liked the look of the site. I used a bland template to create the website quickly. The site was ugly, but it served its purpose. Then Justin Williams created a new “professional web site” for <a href="http://www.justinw.me">himself</a>.</p>

Then Justin Williams created a new “professional web site” for <a href="http://www.justinw.me">himself</a>.</p>

<p>My first thought after seeing Justin’s new site was, “Wow! That looks really nice.” My second thought was, “Man my site sucks donkey balls.” So I spent the last couple of days working on a new look for <a href="http://www.kirbyturner.com">kirbyturner.com</a>. I just finished the site, and I can say with 100% certainty that the new site looks much, much better than my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyturner/16288802435/">old site</a>. Thanks for the inspiration, Justin.</p>

<p>Take a look at the new and improved <a href="http://www.kirbyturner.com">kirbyturner.com</a>, and let me know what you think.</p>
