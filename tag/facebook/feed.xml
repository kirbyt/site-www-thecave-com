    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want an easy way to share certain posts to social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, at the time I publish the post. The more I can automate, the better. The problem is this site is a static HTML site generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>.</p>

<p>So how do I automatically share a post to Facebook or Twitter? That’s what I’m experimenting with right now, and this post is my test post.</p>

<h2 id="whats-going-on">What’s Going On</h2>

<p>For the techies reading this, here’s what I’m doing.</p>

<p>First, I updated my tags plugin to generate an RSS feed file for each tag. Next, I setup <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> to monitor the feed files for the tags “facebook” and “twitter”. When IFTTT detects a new feed file item (i.e., a new blog post), it will post the item to the appropriate social media site. If I want to share a post to Facebook, I simply tag it with “facebook”. And if I want to share the post on Twitter, I tag it with “twitter”.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com">source code for this site</a> is available on <a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com">Github</a> for those who want to look under the hood.</p>

<p>Now to start work on the hard part…writing more blog posts.</p>
