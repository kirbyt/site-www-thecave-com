    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past Wednesday I had a chance to attend <a href="http://www.nshappyhour.org">NSHappyHour</a>. It’s was my first time attending since moving to Vermont two years ago. I had a great time catching up with everyone, and I was reminded just how awesome the Mac and iOS developer community is in the Boston area.</p>

<p>I also was reminded how much I miss the community there, and since moving back isn’t an option for me - snowboard season starts in about 3 months for me - I need to make a point of visit the Boston area more.</p>
