    </h2>
    
    <p>I am pleased to announce the launch of the Hour Children <a href="http://www.hourchildren.org/">web site</a>.  The site was funded through a service grant provided by the <a href="http://www.taprootfoundation.org/">Taproot Foundation</a> of which I am a volunteer.
<br />
<br />Hour Children is a non-profit family service provider providing short- and long-term support to incarcerated mothers, ex-offenders and their children.  It has been an awarding experience to use my skills for an organization that provides such loving care to mothers in need, to their children, and to the community.</p>

    <p>Although it is probably silly to apologize for not posting a new entity in over a month, I still feel compelled.  So I apologize for not posting a new entity in over a month.
<br />
<br />Whew, glad that’s over.
<br />
<br />As you can probably guess, I have been busy over the last month.  I wish I could say I had been spending all my time snowboarding and playing Xbox but I can’t.  I’ve only spent a small amount of time on the slopes and behind the S-controller.  And I’ve been catching up on episodes of Aqua Teen Hunger Focus and Warren Miller TV too.  But the majority of my time has been with White Peak Software.
<br />
<br />I have been doing some exciting work over the last month which I hope to post more about in the coming days and weeks.  For instance, I finally got around to learning how to use the MSI NAntContrib task as part of a build script, and I’ve been working with the PropertyGrid included in the .NET Framework.
<br />
<br />All these ideas floating in my head, I just need to find some time to share them with others.</p>

        <a href="/2004/11/23/halo2-stats/">Halo2 Stats</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>As you can probably tell from the lack of postings to this blog, I have been busy over the last month.  White Peak has new clients, which is where I have been spending most of my time.  But I decided to take a break over the weekend and play Halo2.
<br />
<br />Halo2 is awesome!  The story line is captivating, the graphics are amazing, and game play is fun.  Best of all, Halo2 is Xbox Live compatible.  I started playing online last night with some friends.  After our frag fest party I decided to continue playing in the rank matches.  As expected, every player online is better than me.  But what I really like about the online experience is what happens after you finish a game.
<br />
<br />Bungie.net is tracking all the statistics from the online play, and players can view their stats as well as the stats of others through the Bungie.net web site.  But it doesn’t stop there.  Bungie.net also provides an RSS feed for individual player stats.
<br />
<br />Beginning the geek that I am, I decided to add a new web part to my <a href="http://www.thecave.com/">blog site</a> that shows my Halo2 stats.  You can view a summary in the side bar and view complete details from the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/halo2.aspx">halo2</a> page.
<br />
<br />Now that break time is over, it’s time to get back to real work.</p>

        <a href="/2004/10/26/exciting-prospects-follis-style/">Exciting Prospects Follis Style</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>John Follis, President and Creative Director for <a href="http://www.follisinc.com/">Follis, Inc</a>, spoke at tonight’s <a href="http://www.iccanyc.org/">ICCA NYC</a> meeting about getting prospects excited.  I really enjoyed his talk and he answered many questions I had.  For instance, how does marketing differ from networking?
<br />
<br />The difference between networking and marketing has long been a blur to me.  I often wondered when one stops and the other begins.  As John puts it, networking is one on one while market reaches more than one person.  I am networking when I meet a new person who might be a prospect or a referral to a prospect.  On the other hand, a monthly newsletter is marketing as it will reach out to more than one person at a time.  Having articles published is another form of marketing as it reaches a greater audience than networking alone.
<br />
<br />Another concept John mentioned tonight that I liked is how people perceive the difference between investment and expense as it relates to marketing.  When marketing is done right the cost is an investment while marketing gone wrong is an expense.  Here’s hoping I will continue to invest in my marketing strategy and avoid having a huge marketing expense.
<br />
<br />Lastly, John pointed out that marketing is not just about giving out information.  Giving out information can be stale and boring.  Marketing should tap emotions.  For White Peak Software this means illustrating the experience and excitement felt as the result of a successful software release.  I plan to incorporate the concepts shared by John at tonight’s meeting.  And as with last month’s ICCA meeting, the presentation provided real value to small IT business owners like me.</p>
