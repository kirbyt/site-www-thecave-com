        <a href="/2005/05/17/newsgator-acquires-feeddemon/">NewsGator Acquires FeedDemon</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>If you haven’t heard, NewsGator <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=58">acquires</a> FeedDemon, TopStyle, and <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/">Nick Bradbury</a>.  I have been a huge fan of Nick’s products dating back to the first release of HomeSite many, many years ago.  And I now use FeedDemon on a daily basis.  <br /><br />Nick has been some what of a role model for many developers and micro-ISVs including me.  As I take steps towards producing my own product I am borrowing from tips I have learned from watching Nick grow a successful micro-ISV.  While I am a long way away from reaching the level of success Nick has achieved, I can’t help but wonder if I could allow myself to be acquired.<br /><br />When I say this, I’m not saying I would not consider selling rights to my product to a larger company.  Actually that might be the only way I can fulfill the full vision I have for my product.  What I’m saying, though, is I wonder if I would go to work for a company that acquires my product.  This is exactly what Nick has done with the acquisition of FeedDemon and TopStyle.  He will be the Architect of Client Products for NewsGator.<br /><br />My problem with this is I believe you give up certain freedoms when you work for a larger company as compared to running your own shop.  A hint of this can be seen in the <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/feeddemon.aspx">Q&amp;A;</a> between Nick Bradbury and NewsGator found Greg Reinacker. <br />&lt;div class="quote"&gt;<br />Q: Is Nick going to work for NewsGator? Is he moving to Denver? What will his role be? <br /><br /><b>Greg:</b> Nick is indeed coming to work for NewsGator, as Architect of Client Products. I’m personally very excited to add Nick’s vision and expertise to our company. He’ll continue to work on FeedDemon, but will also add his considerable expertise to our product and platform strategy moving forward. Some of his focuses, other than FeedDemon, will be on user interface and interaction design across the platform, and some of the rich media development we’re working on. <b>And I think he’s moving to Denver.</b><br /><br /><b>Nick:</b> <b>Umm, no, I’m not actually moving.</b><br /><br /><b>Greg:</b> Oh. There I go again - heh. <b>Ok, Nick’s not moving…but he’ll be spending a lot of time with our team in Denver moving forward</b>, and as I said, we’re all looking forward to working closely with him.<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br />But this process if nothing new for Nick.  When HomeSite was acquired so was Nick, and I’m sure he learned a lot from that experience.  In the same Q&amp;A; mentioned above, Nick says:<br />&lt;div class="quote"&gt;<br />Look, I can’t predict the future, and I certainly couldn’t have predicted that HomeSite would be acquired by companies that weren’t sure what to do with it. But I don’t sell my products just to see them wither and die. If anything, this acquisition breathes new life into my software - let’s face it, there’s a limit to what a one-man company can do, and I reached that limit a long time ago!<br /><br />For at least the past year, I’ve spent far more time doing support, marketing and sales than I have doing actual design and development. Joining forces with NewsGator enables me to focus more on development again, and I’m really excited by that.<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br />I hope he is able to stay in Tennessee and focus on development again.  I hope a repeat of HomeSite does not happen.  But regardless of what will happen I have to offer a big congratulations to Nick.  He continues to achieve what most others only dream about.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>After taking a break from the laptop I was able to get a much better handle on interfaces in Delphi.  And I was able to implement the design I wanted.  It’s not as slick as in C# but it works.  And the code is readable, which is important to me.<br /><br />I was returning a TObject when I should have been returning IInterface.  After seeing the code it makes sense to me why my use of TObject was causing problems, and why I was trying to cast an interface from an object, which now I see was not needed.</p>

    <p>I recently posted a list of Delphi key bindings.  I discovered most of the bindings through trial and error or by inspecting the various menus.  I had originally I searched the help file and browsed the help file index but I couldn’t find the list of key binding.  I never thought to look under the contents.  I figure if I can’t find it in the index or search it must not exist.  But it does.  I think I need to spend more time browsing the help file through the content tab and not rely so much on index and search.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>The way interfaces work in Delphi for Win32 stinks.  From what I have read it seems that interfaces were forced in to work with COM.  But even if you are not using COM, interfaces imposes COM like behaviors such as ref counts and interfaces must have a GUID.  But what really ticks me off is that you cannot cast an interface to an object.<br /><br />For years I have abstracted framework and application features through interfaces.  Now I can’t use them and it means I have to change the way I think.  This limitation, which I wish I knew about 2 months ago, makes me think I should have used C# for my app.<br /><br />In the end, I will be happy with my selection of Delphi.  But I’m a bit ticked off at it for the moment.<br /><br />For those using Delphi for .NET, this will not be a problem.  Interfaces work the way you would expect, and you can cast objects to interfaces and interfaces to objects.</p>

    <p>After being off of IM for the last few weeks, I finally got around to re-installing <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a>.  (I still had not installed it after my last hard drive crash.)  I was happy to see a new version since I had been running my registered copy of Trillian Pro 2.x for the last few years.<br /><br />The new version includes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> feature.  It will display the Wikipedia description when you mouse over certain works and phrases.  But it’s not perfect.<br /><br />I mentioned a buddy of name Shawn Murphy.  To my surprise there was a Wikipedia desription for have name.  “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Murphy">Shawn Murphy</a> (born July 27, 1951 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island) is a Canadian politician. Murphy is a current member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the Canadian House of Commons,…”  I’m not sure way but I found this to be funny.  <br /><br />The Wikipedia feature is a neat idea, but I’m not sure how useful it will be for me.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>For over a year I have been running my primary development environment in a guest OS using VMWare Workstation 4.x.  I run in full screen mode and I don’t even notice that I am running under a guest OS.<br /><br />Tonight I installed the new VMWare Workstation 5.0.  I haven’t run it through the ringer yet but I like what I see so far.  Guest OS seem to run faster and network communication is definitely much faster.  The old virtual NIC was only a 10mbps.  The new one is 1gbps, which is noticeably faster.  Although I haven’t played with it, I’m excited about the multiple snapshots feature.  There’s also a new clone feature that I need to read up on.  In my opinion existing 4.x users will want to upgrade to 5.0.</p>
