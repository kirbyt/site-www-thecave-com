    <p>Melanie and I joined the rest of the Davis family for fun in the snow at Killington, VT, for an extended weekend.  Saturday was spent at Pico and was the return to the slopes for Brenna.  She was taking it easy on her first day out, but by the next day she was skiing down Outer Limits.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>Lately I have started feeling the byte of the development bug.  It’s been a while since I wrote any real code and the update to this site has got me wanting to do more.  So to help get started and to fix the work into my job, I decided to write some true interop examples between J2EE and .NET.  Today was all about installing the environment.
<br />
<br />I created a new Windows 2000 Advance Server VM under <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a>, installed <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">J2SE</a>, <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">TomCat</a>, <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Axis</a>, <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">Xerces</a>, and IBM’s <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/webservicestoolkit">Web Services ToolKit</a> (WSTK).  The combination took longer than installing <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">Visual Studio.NET</a>.  Still, I was happy with the amount of online documentation and the ease of use of the various installation programs.  I now have a clean environment ready for me to destroy.  Only regret was that I did not use Windows .NET Server 2003.  Including UDDI Services in my demo code would have been great.</p>

    <p>I checked weather.com this morning to see the weekend forecast in the Killington area.  The report is based on Rutland, VT, which had a chilly, current temp of -8 and windchill of -26.  Burrrrrr…</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>I re-discovered <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> today and I have to say the latest version totally kicks butt!  I’m finally sportin’ a new laptop with lots of RAM and tons of hard drive space so I thought it was time to look at VMWare again.  The latest workstation release, version 3.2, was very easy to install.  And setting up a new virtual machine has never been easier.  I had Windows 2000 Advance Server up and running in a VM session in under 45 minutes.  No re-partitioning of the hard drive is required.  All VM sessions are stored in a collection of files.  Best of all, I can archive a clean install and restore it later after I have totally screwed up the environment.  My next step is to setup an environment running Java, Apache, etc so I can demo .NET/J2EE interop.  All developers should have the freedom of VMWare on their workstation.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>My Xbox died a couple of weeks ago on <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/home.aspx">my trip</a> to Whistler.  Melanie is working this weekend and I have to say I am missing the game play.  So I finally called the Xbox support number to find out my opinions.  The console I have needs repair work which costs $100, shipping included.  A new Xbox will cost $200.  The difference is I can pick up a new Xbox today but it will be a few weeks before my get back my repaired Xbox.
<br />
<br />A part of me wants to repair the box I have mainly because I am close to finishing Transworld Snowboarding.  It’s the only game I have that does not let me copy my saved games to a memory card.  So if I want to continue the game, I have to repair the box.  But I am jonzen to play.  And starting over is not really a big deal either.
<br />
<br />So what should I do?  Should I repair or replace my Xbox?  What would you do?</p>

        <a href="/2003/02/23/an-xbox-support-scam/">An Xbox Support Scam?</a>
    </h2>
    
    <p>Earlier today I called the Xbox support number and talked with a woman about my options for repair of my Xbox.  The cost was $99, which included shipping.  As a matter of fact, she told me they would send me a box to ship my Xbox back to the service center.  Not sure if I wanted to repair or replace, she said I could call back and give my ticket number to complete the repair request.
<br />
<br />So I thought about it a bit and even talked to Melanie to get her opinion.  I decided that spending $100 dollars was better than $200, so I call the support number back.  This time though I was told a different story.  First, it is going to cost $99 plus tax plus shipping bringing my total to $145.  Then to top that, the guy said for another $50 I could buy an extended warranty for my already defective Xbox.  And I have to wait to get my Xbox back should I go with a repair.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.ebgames.com/">EBGames</a> sells factory reconditioned Xbox for $150.  So now the question is do I pay $145 to have my Xbox repaired or $150 to get a reconditioned one, which mine will be after the repair.  If I buy the reconditioned one, I can have it by Tuesday.  If I repair my Xbox, I have to wait at least two weeks.  And let’s not forget I can pay $200 to repair my console and get an extended warranty, or I can pay $200 for a new Xbox with two Sega games.
<br />
<br />I’m starting to think repairing my Xbox is a scam, especially now that I am being told that I have to pay for shipping.  Guess if I had told the first person that I wanted to repair the unit I would not have to pay for shipping, but since I waited 2 hours, now I have to pay.  I don’t get it.  Maybe I will go back to playing my Playstation/2.</p>

    </h2>
    
    <p>12:27 am Sunday morning waiting for the number 6 downtown.  The uptown 4 speeds by on the express line and I realize I am living a surreal moment in New York.  The greatest city in the world, Saturday night, and my evening includes tea and a poetry reading on Bowery, Xbox and Budweiser,  caso dip and conversations about how hard it is dating in New York.  This is my night.  Uptown number 6 stops and people get off.  Couples holding hands.  Guys with their umbrellas.  It must still be raining outside.
<br />
<br />Finally the downtown number 6 arrives.  I board the train and find a seat.  She’s cute but not my Melanie.  A legless man is making his way down the car on his fist with a coffee can of coins.  Hand outs please.  I wonder how he got down into the subway, and I wonder how he will leave.
<br />
<br />My stop…Lafayette and Bleecker St.  It’s raining.  Crack!  Thunder and lightening in February…how weird.  Great the rain is coming down harder.  Just my luck.  “There goes my hair,” says a bridge and tunnel ho.  Many more looking for shelter from the rain.  What losers!  Just walk in it; you won’t melt.  And if you do, who cares.
<br />
<br />A surreal night in New York City.  The words sounded better in my head 30 minutes ago.  Unfortunately for you, this is what you get.</p>
