A quote from the article: “Accenture in July will launch Accenture Web Service and Application Development Platform, which will be available as a hosted service, said Michael Condon, director of the company’s Web services consulting group.”</p>

    <p>Ever feel stupid?  Well I do right now.  Last week I turned on my TV and poof…no picture.  So I pressed the power button on the remote a few more times.  Still no picture.  Next I tried the power button on the TV unit and still no picture.  The TV is toasted I thought
<br />
<br />Not wanting to spend the money on a new TV, I decided to call for home service.  75 bucks for a home visit!  But that is cheaper than a new TV.  So after going almost a week without a TV or <a href="http://www.xbox.com/ampedfreestylesnowboarding/default.htm?cs_catalog=cat%2dus">Amped!</a> for Xbox for that matter, I scheduled an appointment for a service visit between 1 and 5 pm.  Don’t you just love those service windows.  5:15 and no technician.  Figures!  So I call.  He is running late and will be here within an hour.  No problem.  I am working anyway.
<br />
<br />Finally the tech arrives.  I buzz him into the building.  We get ready to move the TV to the floor so he can take off the back of the set.  I unplug the TV before the move and hear what sounds like the TV turning off!  “No!” I think, “Don’t tell me all I needed to do was unplug the TV!”  We move the TV to the floor but before the tech removes the back off the set I plug it back in.  And guess what.  The damn thing turned on!
<br />
<br />75 bucks to have a tech watch me unplug and plug in the TV.  Now talk about feeling stupid.</p>

    <p>I have been slacking on the weblog lately.  What can I say?  I have had too many things going on at the same time.  Hopefully I will find the time to start making new posts.</p>

    <p>This weekend’s geek out weekend involved setting up a new remote development environment for myself.  My plan was to roll out a hosted version of <a href="http://www.cvsnt.org/">CVS</a> (Concurrent Versions System) with secure access via SSH.  I used <a href="http://www.networksimplicity.com/openssh/">OpenSSH on Windows</a> from Network Simplicity, which was easy to install and configure.  OpenSSH also includes SCP, a secure copy program, which I am now using to make backups of important information from my laptop to my file server.  Totally sweet, I must say.
<br />
<br />CVSNT was a bit of a challenge compared to OpenSSH but I did get it installed and running.  The final step was to provide remote access to my CVS repository through a secure tunnel using SSH.  This has proven to be very challenge and I have yet to finish this goal.  I have search the Net over and have learned many others have had the same problems.  This is preventing me from building the desired remote development environment, which means I must continue using VPN access to my Visual Source Safe repository.
<br />
<br />Not all is lost though.  I learned a lot about security, secure access, PKI, OpenSSH and such.  And I have a easy to use, fast, secure process for backing up files from my laptop.  I am not giving up on the challenge either.  I will try again in a couple of weeks when I have more time.</p>

    <p>After spending the last few hours trying to access CVS repository stored on Windows 2000 through SSH, I finally give up.  My final conclusion is the CVSNT does not work SSH when CVSNT is on the server-side.  From all I have read and seen, CVSNT with SSH works fine with the CVS server is some flavor of Unix.  This bums me out because I really don’t care to install Linux at home and I would like to use TortoiseCVS as my WinCVS GUI client.
<br />
<br />All is not lost though.  I think I can use another WinCVS to access my CVS repository.  I was able to successfully access it with the CVS command line using SSPI for Windows authentication.  And by using the -x, you can ensure that the network traffic is encrypted.  Still, I would rather use SSH.</p>

    <p>I’m back from Jamaica and Memphis and back into .NET.  This morning I learned how easy it is to internationalization your ASP.NET applications.  The .NET SDK has a simple to follow <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vbcon/html/vbwlkwalkthroughlocalizingwebforms.asp">walk through</a> explaining how to create and use string resource files and satellite assemblies.  Having built web-based applications that support multiple languages before, I really appreciate how simple it is to internationalize ASP.NET applications.</p>

    <p>I am once again trying to e-mail post feature of <a href="http://pro.blogger.com/">blogger.com</a>.  I really like the idea of this feature but I have been experiencing problems with it in the past.  I just noticed a series of tests were finally posted to my weblog weeks after the messages were originally sent.  Hopefully that problem has been fix.

    <p>Congratulations to my sister Renay and her new husband Tommy, who were married earlier today.  It is really hard to believe my little sister has become a beautiful young lady.  I wish the two of them total happiness in their new life as husband and wife.  And a special “good luck” to Tommy who is going to need it.  Just joking, Renay.  I love you both.</p>

    <p>Not like anyone really cares, but I am heading out of town again.  KC last weekend.  NYC this week.  And early tomorrow Melanie and I will be heading off to Jamaica for some fun in the sun.  We will be stopping over in Memphis mid-week to visit with friends and family, and to watch my sister get married.  It’s hard to believe she is not a kid any more.</p>
