    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine told me this morning she quit her job and is now freelancing as an iOS developer. She asked if I had any advice to share. The first thoughts to pop into my mind were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read all you can from <a href="https://doubleyourfreelancing.com">Brennan Dunn</a></li>
  <li>Read all you can from <a href="https://expensiveproblem.com">Jonathan Stark</a></li>
  <li>Read all you can from <a href="http://ryanwaggoner.com">Ryan Waggoner</a></li>
  <li>Subscribe to Matt Inglot’s <a href="https://freelancetransformation.com">Freelance Transformation podcast</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I talked about my workflow for finding new freelance work at last year’s <a href="https://360idev.com">360idev</a> conference. Unfortunately, the video recording got corrupted, so you can’t watch the talk. But I do have a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wo4r3jnjnilguzu/freelancers-guide-to-finding-work.pdf?dl=0">PDF</a> of slide deck that includes a transcript of the talk that some might find helpful.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thecave.com/2017/05/01/im-trying-something-different/"/>
    <published>2017-05-01T14:38:16+00:00</published>
    <updated>2017-05-01T14:38:16+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2017/05/01/im-trying-something-different</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been working for myself for nearly 14 years, and it has been an incredible experience. During that time I’ve had a couple of bad years, but in general, each year has been better than the previous year. In fact, 2016 was my best year ever. It was the year I learned from some amazing mentors how to be a better business owner, which resulted in me working on great projects and having my highest revenue year ever.</p>

<p>But on the heels of that success, I’ve decided I need to do something different. That’s why, as of today, I’m an <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a> employee.</p>

<p>For those wanting more details, here’s what I can share. I am staying in Vermont and working as a remote employee. I will be making trips out to Cupertino from time to time – I’m actually in Cupertino today. I’ve joined the DevPubs team where I get to combine my passion for writing code with my love for writing words. And I plan to snowboard almost every morning next winter season, so this is more of a career change and less of a lifestyle change for me.</p>

<p>Joining Apple wasn’t an easy decision for me. I love <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com">White Peak Software</a>, and I’m proud of the accomplishments I’ve made over the years. The company is a big part of who I am, so I’m not just leaving a job, I’m saying goodbye to a part of me.</p>

<p>At the same time, I love what Apple is doing, and for me, it’s not just about the technology coming out of Cupertino. I truly believe <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/">Apple is helping to make this world a better place</a>, and I want to be a part of that. So while there is a part of me that is sad I’m leaving my company, a much larger part of me is excited. Excited to try something different, and excited to do my part in helping make this a better world for my son.</p>

<p>To my clients and customers, thank you, thank you, thank you! Without you, the last 14 years would not have happened, and I will be forever grateful to you for your support and trust in me.</p>

<p>To my wife, Melanie, and my son, Rowan, thank you for joining me on the 14 year roller coaster ride. It has been quiet the thrill ride, for sure. And don’t worry, we still have plenty more thrilling times ahead of us.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thecave.com/2017/04/21/how-i-post-to-my-jekyll-site-using-my-iphone/"/>
    <published>2017-04-21T12:53:10+00:00</published>
    <updated>2017-04-21T12:53:10+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thecave.com/2017/04/21/how-i-post-to-my-jekyll-site-using-my-iphone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My blog site, <a href="https://www.thecave.com">thecave.com</a>, is a static HTML site generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. I love that the site is static HTML as it means I can host the site virtually anywhere. But, unlike dynamic blog sites, like those powered by <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, I haven’t been able to publish new posts from my iPhone. And with the upcoming release of <a href="http://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, creating new micro-posts for thecave.com from my iPhone is something I want to do, but how? How can I update my Jekyll site, with its source code hosted on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and custom plug-ins that can’t run on Github Pages, using my iPhone?</p>

<p>I set out to answer this question, and low and behold; I found the answer. Well, the answer that works for me.</p>

<h2 id="theres-an-app-for-that">There’s an App for That</h2>

<p>First, I need an app on my iPhone that lets me push changes to my site’s Github repository. In other words, I need a git client on iOS. I decided to use <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a>. It’s a great app and easy to use. Best of all you can try it out for free. The app developer offers a 1-week free trial that lets you push changes to a git repo. After the trial period expires, you must pay to unlock the push feature, but the $14.99 price tag is well worth it in my opinion.</p>

<p>Next, I need a way to write my posts. Working Copy has a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> editor built in, which is great for editing existing posts. But there are better editors in the App Store. First, I tried 1Writer since I already have it, and I use it for writing notes and such. Unfortunately, it didn’t play well with Working Copy, so I continued my search for the ideal editor.</p>

<p><a href="https://bywordapp.com">Byword</a>, the next app I looked at, looks beautiful, and reviewers have commented how they are using it with Working Copy. But I ended up not trying Byword because I discovered Editorial.</p>

<p><a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> has a built-in workflow engine, and while this app might not look as pretty as Byword, it is much more powerful, thanks to a built-in workflow engine, and suited to my needs. I bought Editorial right away and started playing with different workflows that already work with Working Copy. After some trial and error, I created two workflows. One lets me publish a post to thecave.com, and the other lets me publish a micro-post.</p>

<p>The difference between the two workflows is subtle. The workflow I use to publish a post lets me pick a category and add tags. The micro-post workflow lets me choose a category and add other tags. For my micro-post to be picked up by micro.blog, I must use the tag “micropost,” and this workflow enforces this rule. Also, my micro-post workflow sets an empty title in the front matter YAML, which brings me to the question…</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-need-these-workflows">Why Do I Need These Workflows?</h2>

<p>The workflows save me time and simplify the publish steps. For instance, Jekyll uses YAML as <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">front matter</a> for each post. There’s no way I want to write this front matter by hand on my iPhone each time. I can use TextExpander, but seeing the front matter can be distracting on my iPhone. So I let Editorial’s workflow work its magic to generate the YAML front matter before handing off the document to Working Copy.</p>

<p>The workflow also names the file with the appropriate YYYY-MM-DD prefix that Jekyll expects, and it does one other thing for me as well. It sends the appropriate commands to Working Copy so it can add, commit, and push the new document to my git repository. And after Working Copy finishes its job, it returns me back to Editorial.</p>

<p>Simply put, the Editorial workflow lets me publish a new post with just a few taps of my finger.</p>

<h2 id="sharing-my-workflows">Sharing My Workflows</h2>

<p>I shared my two workflows on <a href="http://www.editorial-workflows.com">Editorial Workflows</a>, which is a directory of workflows. You can use them as is or tweak them to your liking. You must, however, set the key and repo name variables at the start of the workflow as these will be unique to your install of Working Copy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5790030849114112/WIlXHDBWQBQ">KT: Send Jekyll Post using Working Copy</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5335890234703872/dIfk8O40fDM">KT: Send micropost using Working Copy</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-custom-jekyll-plug-ins">Using Custom Jekyll Plug-ins</h2>

<p>If you are using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to generate your blog site, and you host your site on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, then all you need is <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> and <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> to publish new content from your iPhone. That is, assuming you are not using custom plug-ins. If you are not using custom plug-ins, then Github Pages will generate the Jekyll site for you when you push changes to the master branch. I, however, use a custom plug-ins for <a href="https://www.thecave.com">thecave.com</a>, which means Github Pages will not generate my site for me.</p>

<p>Because I use custom plug-ins, I must generate my site locally using my laptop. This means I cannot publish new content from my iPhone. Or so I thought.</p>

<h2 id="using-continuous-integration-to-build-a-jekyll-site">Using Continuous Integration to Build a Jekyll Site</h2>

<p>It occurred to me that I can use a build server or continuous integration (CI) environment to build my site when changes are pushed to the master branch. After all, I do this with the iOS apps I make.</p>

<p>My CI of choice is <a href="https://www.bitrise.io">Bitrise</a>. It provides continuous integration and delivery services for mobile apps, but it can also be used to generate a Jekyll site. Best of all, their “free forever” <a href="https://www.bitrise.io/pricing">Hobby plan</a> can be used to generate a Jekyll site and push it out to Github Pages. Here’s my <a href="https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com/blob/master/bitrise.yml">bitrise.yml</a> that defines the Bitrise workflow steps that build and publish my Jekyll site.</p>

<h2 id="and-thats-how-i-do-it">And That’s How I Do It</h2>

<p>That’s how I publish new content to <a href="https://www.thecave.com">thecave.com</a> using my iPhone. I admit it’s a bit geeky, but know that it is setup, I can publish new posts from iPhone with a tap of my finger.</p>
